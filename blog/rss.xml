            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Wasp team is on a mission to build the world's best full-stack web framework for JS. End-to-end solution and DX of Rails/Laravel, but with JS and your favorite tools. Future-proof and here to stay.</em></p><p>It’s been a while since we caught up with the people behind Wasp—the ones turning ideas into code and shaping the future of web development. As <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Careers-59fd1682c80d446f92be5fa65cc17672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we are actively growing the team</a>, we decided to catch up with people who already joined us. In this post, we've interviewed Miho who joined Wasp in 2023. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-start-with-two-truths-and-a-lie-about-yourself">Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself.<a href="#lets-start-with-two-truths-and-a-lie-about-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself." title="Direct link to Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself.">​</a></h3><ol><li>I recently became a one-star scuba diver.</li><li>I played the guitar in music school.</li><li>In one of my previous jobs, I designed the face of Croatia’s COVID chatbot.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="image.png" src="/assets/images/image-bb73dd25c46b87602f2ee4d22e44b1fe.png" width="750" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="which-statement-was-the-lie-above-any-interesting-stories-to-share">Which statement was the lie above?

Any interesting stories to share?" title="Direct link to Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?">​</a></h3><p>I mean, it’s nothing too dramatic, but I actually played the piano. I liked playing it, but I wasn’t really that good at it. I liked creating electronic music using Fruity Loops Studio more in those days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqEBbPNDc50" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s a really old song I made</a>.</p><p>Also, I really became a one-star scuba diver recently!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-you-join-wasp-what-did-you-do-before">Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?<a href="#why-did-you-join-wasp-what-did-you-do-before" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?" title="Direct link to Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?">​</a></h3><p>In my previous company Superbet, I worked on a client in Vue.js for sports betting. I started as an individual contributor, became a tech lead and eventually started a team that worked on cross platform tooling. That’s one of the things that prompted me to contribute to open source tools like <a href="https://github.com/directus/directus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directus</a> and I really enjoyed doing that. </p><p>I realized that like working on dev tooling, helping other devs to do their job easier. I liked the open source community vibe and thought “it would be awesome to be a part of it!”. Being in the web development for over 10 years and knowing the complexity behind it made Wasp stand out to me. Working on open source dev tooling that made web dev 10x easier? Nice! This made <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> really a perfect fit for me. Luckily, it turned out that guys at Wasp liked me back 🙂</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-favorite-language">What is your favorite language?<a href="#what-is-your-favorite-language" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is your favorite language?" title="Direct link to What is your favorite language?">​</a></h3><p>These days I’m all about Typescript and Haskell since at Wasp we are trying to create the full stack framework for JavaScript and our compiler is in Haskell. I’d say I like languages with types because you can model your problem with them and then the compiler will give you errors if you make mistakes. Also, I like immutability in programming languages because again, the compiler helps you to avoid errors. So, I’m all about languages that dig a pit of success for you.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp">What are you most excited about in Wasp?<a href="#what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?" title="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?">​</a></h3><p>I find the concept of full stack modules quite exciting. It’s like having legos of functionality you plug into your app. Something like Stripe payments support. You’d install something like <code>wasp/stripe</code> and get the client UI, server logic and database entities working together. That kind of ability to solve your business problem with a simple module install feels really powerful to me. I’d like to have this as a developer, but I didn’t see that kind of solution in the JS ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-feature-or-project-youre-most-proud-of-that-you-worked-on-in-the-past-three-months">What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?<a href="#whats-a-feature-or-project-youre-most-proud-of-that-you-worked-on-in-the-past-three-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?" title="Direct link to What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?">​</a></h3><p>I like the work that we did on moving away from Wasp’s custom entity syntax to just using the Prisma file directly. We used Prisma under the hood the whole time, but users had to use our own syntax. Now that’s no longer the case and people can just use Prisma as they are used to. I really like the concept of enabling devs to use the skills they already have. I worked on the parser for the Prisma file format and it was really a fun technical challenge! It enables Wasp to understand your Prisma models and configuration which allows it to generate logic based on your database setup.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-start-coding">How did you start coding?<a href="#how-did-you-start-coding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did you start coding?" title="Direct link to How did you start coding?">​</a></h3><p>When I was 11 years old, I started programming in a visual programming language called Logo. You write down commands and a small turtle draws things on the screen. I used to go to competitions in Logo. So you could say I was a competitive turtle user. By the time I was 14, blogs were a thing and I wanted to change some colors of my blog homepage, so I had to learn a bit of CSS. Or should I say, learn how to copy paste some code and tweak it until it worked. I was always that kind of learner, playing around, messing things up and then finally figuring it out.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Miho at a conference" src="/assets/images/miho-a8f18efcae36d83320a8142e1942823d.jpg" title="Miho at a conference" width="986" height="1480" class="img_ev3q">
<em>Miho recently gave a talk at <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2024/12/11/armadajs-2024-a-conference-that-feels-like-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArmadaJS</a>.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-dev-setup">Your dev setup?<a href="#your-dev-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your dev setup?" title="Direct link to Your dev setup?">​</a></h3><p>I’m used to doing everything on my MacBook Pro M2 and oftentimes without an external screen because I like to travel and work. I’m using VS Code, Warp terminal emulator and Raycast shortcuts for window management. That’s pretty much it, my setup is as basic as it gets. Before when I was on Linux, I used to play around more, but since I’m on MacOS, I just don’t have the need - maybe it’s the OS, maybe it’s me getting older 😀</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-current-favorite-gem-library-tool-or-anything-else-that-helps-you-with-your-work-why">What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work?

Why?" title="Direct link to What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work? Why?">​</a></h3><p>I love using Zod for env variables validation, it makes me feel nice and cozy knowing they are validated and not just some <code>string | undefined</code> wild west. </p><p>Another thing I love using these days is <a href="http://bolt.new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bolt.new</a> which gives you superpowers to build a demo app for some idea you have and then you can start playing around with functioning code. It unlocks you as the dev from setting up the boring bits before you can start playing around.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-budding-developers">One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?<a href="#one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-budding-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?" title="Direct link to One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?">​</a></h3><p>Build stuff. But own the whole process, the product, the design, the deployment and of course the development. I say it in that way because I feel like a lot of devs never get the chance to experience all the others things around their job - but there are so many valuable lessons to learn. You’ll understand your counterparts in other departments, you’ll learn their language, you’ll understand their world and that will make you a 10x developer. Build stuff, and who knows where it might take you.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lastly-where-can-people-find-or-connect-with-you-online">Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?<a href="#lastly-where-can-people-find-or-connect-with-you-online" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?" title="Direct link to Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?">​</a></h3><p>Here’s my pretty slow paced <a href="https://ilakovac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> and my more up to date <a href="https://x.com/infomiho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It took us a few days to wrap our thoughts after attending <a href="https://armada-js.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArmadaJS</a>, a small but exciting conference in Novi Sad, Serbia. People usually believe that bigger conferences are better, but the fact that this one was on a smaller scale meant that it was easer for us to closely connect and talk with other attendees.</p><p>In short, we had an amazing time, and in this post, we’ll share all the highlights and fun moments from the event!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="conference booth" src="/assets/images/1-2203d5ca3f0a202abe583590b0696da6.webp" width="4000" height="3000" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-general-idea---present-the-secret-behind-wasps-success">Our general idea - present the "secret" behind Wasp's success<a href="#our-general-idea---present-the-secret-behind-wasps-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our general idea - present the &quot;secret&quot; behind Wasp's success" title="Direct link to Our general idea - present the &quot;secret&quot; behind Wasp's success">​</a></h2><p>Wasp’s co-founders are usually the ones who get to give a speech about our open-source and full stack philosophy, but this time our founding engineer <a href="https://github.com/infomiho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mihovil</a> had the honor of being the speaker.  We wanted to test the audience’s response to his speech and to have a fun booth where people could have a blast by playing our custom made arcade and a game - a Super Mario-style performer where you have to run away from a scary monster.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="playing the arcade" src="/assets/images/2-bebaa6c7800d1b1c9576c4d71ddf6c5e.webp" width="6048" height="4024" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-star-of-the-show---miho">The star of the show - Miho!<a href="#the-star-of-the-show---miho" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The star of the show - Miho!" title="Direct link to The star of the show - Miho!">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://x.com/infomiho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miho</a> is an experienced senior full-stack engineer with a passion for web, scuba diving, and learning languages. </p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to give a shoutout to the conference photographer, who took some amazing shots of our team and also fought hard to win a plushie himself. Better luck next time! 😄</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mihovil" src="/assets/images/3-ce4b316588c0b2f749fe29887b21e988.webp" width="3644" height="5477" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The name of Miho’s talk was “Crafting a full-stack framework's DX worth 15,000 GitHub stars”. Miho explained the design principles behind Wasp, which allowed us to create a full-stack framework with a great experience out-of-the-box, but still isn’t limiting and gives developers the freedom of doing this their own way when they want or need so.</p><p>In other words, if you want simplicity, with Wasp you get it out of the box, but if you want to take over the reigns, you can also do that by going one level deeper. The feature he described in depth was our <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/auth/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">auth system</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Miho at the stage" src="/assets/images/4-1fe4ec0fa15a947645a724de997a173b.webp" width="6048" height="4024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We won’t spill all the beans in this post, since we hope Miho to attend more conferences with his talk. If you want us to join your JS conference, let us know at <a href="mailto:info@wasp-lang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@wasp-lang.com</a> 🤓</p><p>We also had a chance to connect with others in the open source space who keep pushing web forward, and got some nice feedback and questions about Wasp as a framework and our plans for the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-arcade">The arcade<a href="#the-arcade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The arcade" title="Direct link to The arcade">​</a></h2><p>We built this one from ground up ourselves, or to be more precise, <a href="https://x.com/MatijaSosic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matija</a> did. His best man created the hardware and Matija developed the original version of the game for his wedding. The idea was to get his best man to run away from the band members. The band members were expecting tips from Matija’s best man, and in order to escape, he had to pick up coffee boosters as he was running away. There were obstacles in the shape of brandy, so you know, the more brandy you have, the slower you are, and the band members take all your money in the end.</p><p>The arcade game is open source and written in Lua, so if you feel like giving it a shot, you can <a href="https://github.com/matijaSos/wedding-arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find it here</a>. We took this game and changed the visuals, tweaked it a bit more, and now our Waspy is the star of the game, running away from a …. very unique monster. I won’t spoil all the fun in this post. 😎</p><p>The ones with the best scores got Waspy plushies, and a ban from playing the game again. That means the next day, a new group of people get to have more fun!</p><p>Winners from day 1 were successful in their mission to get a few versions of Waspy back home, to Croatia, while another one ended up in Serbia.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="day 1 winners" src="/assets/images/5-d5a830086ea89724af7d857ea5ebe24e.webp" width="4000" height="3000" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On day 2, we had 4 winners because the 3rd place players had the exact same score. (We decided not to take the consideration the fact that the difference was 0.5 between them, technically speaking one was a nanometer better than the other one.) We’re nice people, what can I say 😃</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="day 2 winners" src="/assets/images/6-713355a583d1c3420613e58f44d832fe.webp" width="5785" height="3849" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thank-you">Thank you<a href="#thank-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thank you" title="Direct link to Thank you">​</a></h2><p>We are really thankful to the whole ArmadaJS team for their amazing support and all the effort they put into this conference. We also want to thank all the attendees, especially the ones who were constantly keeping us entertained and the booth occupied. We hope you enjoyed our company as much as we enjoyed yours!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our form has three data types: strings, a date, and a boolean. We’ll apply validation to most fields: <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code> are required, while <code>email</code> utilises the built-in e-mail validation. Zod simplifies validating common string types with built-in validations for different types, like emails, URLs, and UUIDs, which is helpful for our email field.</p><p>For additional validations, the date can’t be set to a future date, and the <code>premiumUser</code> field simply needs to be a boolean. Zod also provides default validation error messages, but these can be customized. For example, instead of <code>name: z.string().min(1)</code>, we could specify <code>name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required')</code>.</p><div class="language-tsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0

Apart from setting default values and determining whether to call <code>createCustomer</code> or <code>updateCustomer</code>, all other aspects of form handling remain the same.</p><div class="language-tsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-tsx codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">type</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token class-name">FormData</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> z</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token property-access">infer</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">typeof</span><span class="token plain"> formSchema</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">const</span><span class="token plain"> form </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token generic-function function" style="color:#d73a49">useForm</span><span class="token generic-function generic class-name operator" style="color:#393A34">&lt;</span><span class="token generic-function generic class-name">FormData</span><span class="token generic-function generic class-name operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  resolver</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">zodResolver</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">formSchema</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  defaultValues</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> customer</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The final step is to create the form itself and assemble it in the TSX file.

Whether we’re using text inputs, date pickers, or checkboxes with Shadcn controls, we follow a similar structure:</p><ul><li>Start by creating the <code>FormField</code> element and setting its <code>control</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>render</code> properties.</li><li>The <code>render</code> property is key, as it contains the form element itself.</li><li>Typically, we wrap

method.</li><li>Finally, we include <code>FormMessage</code> below, which displays the Zod validation message if validation fails.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="form with errors"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're back with our series of posts in which we interview open-source maintainers and showcase their amazing projects they keep pushing. This week we've talked with <a href="https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pilcrow</a>, an inspiring young dev from Japan, famous for his auth library Lucia and love for auth and security. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia</a> is one of the open-source tools that we use under-the-hood at Wasp. It grew to 9.5K stars on GitHub since October 2023. Although Lucia itself will be deprecated as a library in 2025 and converted into a <a href="https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia/discussions/1714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learning resource</a>, Pilcrow is also working on other projects related to auth, such as Copenhagen and Oslo. You can learn more about his work and projects on his <a href="https://pilcrowonpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>.</p><p>We hope this interview inspires you to contribute to the open-source community yourself. Let's dive in!</p><ul><li><strong>Could you tell us a little about yourself and how you got into coding? What led you to focus on authentication and tooling for developers?</strong></li></ul><p>I’m Pilcrow. I’m a university student in Japan working on various open source projects around auth and security. I started programming like 4 years ago so I'm still new to the field. I love designing APIs a lot and that's probably the biggest reason I enjoy working on libraries.</p><ul><li><strong>Lucia brought you recognition within the dev community. What inspired you to create it, and how did you decide to dedicate so much time and effort to it?</strong></li></ul><p>I was asked to build several websites for school events and the part I struggled with the most was auth. Half of it was my inexperience, but I also found third-party offerings like Firebase to be unintuitive. Most of their features and APIs at the time were aimed at SPAs as well and didn't work well with server-rendered applications. The open source offerings weren't great either. To this day, I still don't really know how to actually use NextAuth (now Auth.js) or Passport.js.</p><p>Over summer break, I decided to build a more leaner NextAuth for SvelteKit so I could use it for my projects. It was my first open source library but it got some attention in the Svelte community. I made it framework agnostic a little while later and it grew naturally.</p><p>Working on it got me hooked on library development, and I found designing APIs and even documenting them to be very enjoyable.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span><mdxadmonitiontitle>[Would you star us on GitHub?]</mdxadmonitiontitle></div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>If you'd like to keep reading more about other open-source maintainers and help Wasp grow, could you please <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star us on GitHub as a sign of your support</a>? 🙏</p></div></div><ul><li><strong>Managing an open-source project like Lucia must come with challenges. What were some unexpected hurdles, and how did you handle them?</strong></li></ul><p>I honestly don't find anything about maintaining open-source projects specifically to be challenging. It just requires a lot of your time with answering questions on Discord and writing documentation. I've definitely changed my approach to library development from when I started though. I now put most of my effort into designing APIs and writing documentation over adding new features.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mGK1g88HZRa2FlKGbz/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611pf6oxpvnttw8a1ej43c0c8escbmkyvschhu7wr9f&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="giphy applause" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><strong>You're also working on <a href="https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/copenhagen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Copenhagen Book</a>, which focuses on authentication guidelines. Why is authentication such a key area of interest for you?</strong></li></ul><p>I find figuring why something is and isn't vulnerable a fun mystery to solve. I also love that there are so many rabbit holes you can find yourself in. You're searching about some protocol one moment and the next you're reading a 50-page RFC on some obscure encoding format. It's a field that pushes you to learn more.</p><p>(As a bonus, I don't have to deal with CSS).</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/pilcrowonpaper/oslo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oslo</a> provides auth-related utilities. Could you walk us through its main features and the problem space it addresses?</strong></li></ul><p>Oslo is a collection of packages for various auth and cryptographic operations. Base64, WebAuthn, SHA-256, ECDSA, TOTP/HOTP, ASN.1, etc. It doesn't rely on third-party dependencies or runtime-specific APIs, so it's super lean and runs everywhere. The APIs are relatively low-level compared to similar libraries as well. It requires some knowledge on the underlying standards, but you don't need to learn any library-specific concepts, which is a very big win in my book.</p><p>Also, it's a very simple feature but just having some kind of documentation is a big plus.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you balance your time across multiple open-source projects while ensuring each gets the attention it deserves?</strong></li></ul><p>I wish I had a better system, but I just work on whatever I feel like. I’m not very good at multi-tasking and prefer focusing on one thing at a time. I don't get a lot of bug reports anyway so it works for me.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you keep up with evolving security standards across projects, and what advice would you give to teams building their own auth solutions from scratch?</strong></li></ul><p>To be honest, I don't think web application security evolves that fast. At least compared to the JavaScript ecosystem (but I guess nothing does). It's rare for a cryptographic algorithm to break overnight and the threat model and basic recommendation is still the same from 10 years ago. A lot of vulnerabilities are still broken access controls and insufficient input sanitation.</p><p>But just a lot of reading. Understand the framework and protocols you're dealing with. RFCs and documentations already cover a lot of possible pitfalls. I guess this applies to those who are planning to delegate auth to a third party as well, at least to some extent.</p><ul><li><strong>Open-source maintainers often struggle with burnout. How do you stay motivated, and what keeps you coming back to these projects?</strong></li></ul><p>Maintaining various projects definitely helps with avoiding burnout. My projects aren’t that big in scale and actual bug reports are rare, so I don’t worry about switching my focus to a different project or taking a break for a week or two.</p><p>I also see open source as just a hobby. I'll still try to address bugs quickly, but I don't rush myself to add new features.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcWF3ZGRwNjFmYmVzanM0d3ZydzNjd2w5bTlxMWlqd294aWwzNmZzMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/q10hztkXiFFmhBbH2l/giphy.gif" alt="relax gif" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><strong>When collaborating on open-source, how do you manage community contributions and keep other developers involved in a meaningful way?</strong></li></ul><p>I don't think my projects are particularly good examples of open source collaborations. I usually ask people to open GitHub issues for new features and I'm not really open to pull requests except for bug and typo fixes. I like to take my time experimenting with various API designs and I personally find it easier if I do the initial design phase by myself. There's also a certain flavor of code I like and I really want to keep my code "beautiful" (yes, I know it sounds dumb).</p><p>To be honest, I don't like pull requests in general since I feel like I wasted the contributor's time if I reject it, even if the code is objectively awful.</p><p>I'm well aware that this closed approach doesn't work in bigger projects, but working on open source is ultimately just a hobby, so I think I should be able to have some fun with it.</p><p>Most of the community aspect comes from Discord, and I really appreciate people who are active daily and answer questions there. Honestly, it's probably some of the most valuable contributions I receive.</p><ul><li><strong>What would you do differently in the development and management of your projects, knowing what you know now about open-source and developer tools?</strong></li></ul><p>Defining the scope and goals of a project early on. I don’t blame myself for not thinking much ahead when starting Lucia since it was literally my first open source library, but it would’ve made development on subsequent major releases much easier. There’s only so many features you can add to a project before the code becomes a mess. You can’t appease everyone, so pick a lane and be the best for that purpose.</p><p>I also think that libraries that are flexible in how and where they can be used, instead of flexible in their behavior, are more predictable and easier to work with. Clearly defining the line between library and user responsibility is going to make it much more enjoyable to use.</p><ul><li><strong>What is your favorite type of ramen?</strong></li></ul><p>Probably tonkotsu, specifically from Kyushu (the third-largest island of Japan's four main islands). The broth is based on pork bones, which gives it a creamy and rich texture, and the noodle has a bite to it (like al dente pasta).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://prd-static.gltjp.com/glt/data/article/21000/20290/20230407_103858_503a919a_w1920.webp" alt="Tonkatsu ramen" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Hope you enjoyed this interview.

So are we - despite the vacation season and all the sunshine that kept distracting us, we kept ourselves busy. We closed the curtains and cranked those A/C's on, and brought to you a whole new release of Wasp, as fresh as a cucumber!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Charnold" src="/img/lw7/charnold.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">You see?

That means we also have to keep track of how these tools evolve and update their versions in Wasp (aka make them modern) - and that's exactly what we did for this release!</p><p>This launch week isn't so much about introducing new, flashy features (although we have some, and yes, it's TypeScript SDK, and yes, you can try it out), but rather about making what we have better and more up-to-date.</p><p>Let's take a look together at the nice things that v0.15 brings us:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-level-up-️-prisma-5-react-router-6-expressjs">#1: Level up ⬆️: Prisma 5, React Router 6, Express.js<a href="#1-level-up-️-prisma-5-react-router-6-expressjs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #1: Level up ⬆️: Prisma 5, React Router 6, Express.js" title="Direct link to #1: Level up ⬆️: Prisma 5, React Router 6, Express.js">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="level up" src="/img/lw7/level-up.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">What you will feel like wielding the latest Wasp release (just imagine the flames are yellow).</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>As mentioned above, we got to keep up with the trends! Here's what's new:</p><ul><li><strong>Upgraded Prisma to v5</strong> - no major interface changes, but brings a lot of performance improvements which also make Wasp faster by default 🏎️</li><li><strong>React Router is now at v6</strong> - v6 has been around for a while (you can see the the main changes from v5 <a href="https://blog.saeloun.com/2021/12/02/new-features-in-react-router-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and it made the code even more compact and elegant.</li><li><strong>We cleaned up and bumped a lot of other dependencies</strong> - including Express.js on which we base Wasp’s API layer and our type-safe RPC.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-ts-sdk-early-preview----give-it-a-spin-and-let-us-know-what-you-think">#2: TS SDK early preview 🤩 - give it a spin and let us know what you think!<a href="#2-ts-sdk-early-preview----give-it-a-spin-and-let-us-know-what-you-think" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #2: TS SDK early preview 🤩 - give it a spin and let us know what you think!" title="Direct link to #2: TS SDK early preview 🤩 - give it a spin and let us know what you think!">​</a></h2><p>During the last launch week we gave you a hint of how the TS SDK for Wasp might look like, and the response we got from you was amazing!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve just built your SaaS web app and deployed it on a production server, you might be running into email deliverability issues. Transactional or marketing emails might not be landing in your users' inboxes. Don’t panic! This is a pretty common problem, especially for apps that run on newly registered domains.</p><p>We have seen a lot of <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> users facing similar challenges, thinking their toolkit was to blame. In our Discord community, we regularly help users who’ve just launched their first app with Wasp, and we've seen this issue pop up frequently. The bad news: your users and their email servers pulled a Gandalf move on you. The good news: no worries, this is something you can fix!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/WpD30tFjzosDn7amXq/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc68jh5kd0zboo37lcp48knhd8bewokjgz7kc9juwov&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="Gandalf saying you shall not pass" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-build-up-your-domain-reputation">1. <strong>Build up your domain reputation</strong><a href="#1-build-up-your-domain-reputation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-build-up-your-domain-reputation" title="Direct link to 1-build-up-your-domain-reputation">​</a></h2><p>A new domain is often flagged as suspicious by email providers, causing your emails to land in spam or not be delivered at all. Google’s filtering is really heavy, especially if you’re trying to reach people with business addresses (<a href="mailto:user@theircompany.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user@theircompany.com</a>). Even the basic signup confirmations have a high chance of bouncing when you’re sending them from a freshly registered domain.</p><p>To improve your domain reputation, do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a custom domain for your emails</strong>: If you’re still using a generic email service like Gmail, switch to a custom domain. This makes you more trustworthy and looks more professional.</li><li><strong>Warm-up your domain</strong>: You need to do this before you start onboarding your users. Any type of sudden bursts of emails from a new domain can be flagged as spam. For example, if you decide to launch on Product Hunt, you’ll get a spike in signups which increases the amount of sent emails. It’s possible that this spike triggers the alarms, and people stop receiving your emails. <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Email+warmup+tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There are numerous tools out there</a> that can help you with this process. Don’t skip this step, it’s mandatory.</li><li><strong>Keep the sending volume consistent</strong>: Regular email sending patterns are seen as trustworthy. Inconsistent or high-volume bursts from a new domain can trigger spam filters.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-authenticate-your-domain">2. <strong>Authenticate your domain</strong><a href="#2-authenticate-your-domain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2-authenticate-your-domain" title="Direct link to 2-authenticate-your-domain">​</a></h2><p>Authentication adds a layer of security to your emails, proving to email providers that you’re a legitimate sender and not the next prince of spam from the land of Spamlia. Here are the key records you need to set up with your DNS provider:</p><ul><li><strong>SPF</strong>: This allows email servers to verify that emails sent from your domain are really coming from you.</li><li><strong>DKIM</strong>: This attaches a digital signature to your emails that enables email servers to confirm the email wasn’t tampered with in transit.</li><li><strong>DMARC</strong>: this one helps you control how your email domain handles unauthenticated emails.</li></ul><p>Read more about these records and how to add them to your DNS servers <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/ZdrDsXfFz1ZRhZQpLZ/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6zjvsa5atns4qklo6odlg3zjir92fy34lvymyfmx1&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="A girl saying and you're going to fix it" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-use-professional-email-sending-tools">3. <strong>Use professional email sending tools</strong><a href="#3-use-professional-email-sending-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-use-professional-email-sending-tools" title="Direct link to 3-use-professional-email-sending-tools">​</a></h2><p>Instead of sending emails directly from your own server, consider using a third-party email service that specializes in this area. Tools like <strong>SendGrid</strong> or <strong>Mailgun</strong> have built-in features to help ensure your emails make it to the inbox. Wasp helps you to <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/advanced/email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add them to your stack</a> with minimal configuration needed on your end.</p><p>They monitor and improve your domain reputation, manage bounces, and handle email authentication out-of-the-box. We’d recommend you to offload sending emails to them, so that you can focus on the core aspects of your business.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-monitor-your-deliverability">4. <strong>Monitor your deliverability</strong><a href="#4-monitor-your-deliverability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-monitor-your-deliverability" title="Direct link to 4-monitor-your-deliverability">​</a></h2><p>It’s important to keep an eye on how your emails are performing. Look for key metrics like bounce rate, open rate, and spam complaints. Most email sending services provide insights into your email deliverability, allowing you to make adjustments before your reputation gets damaged.</p><ul><li><strong>Bounce rate</strong>: High bounce rates suggest you’re sending to invalid or outdated email addresses. Regularly clean your list to avoid this.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaloyan-stoyanov-466a54196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kaloyan Stoyanov</strong></a>, a tech lead who turned his passion project into a full-fledged SaaS product, and sold it within days of launching it. </p><p>A year before officially launching <a href="https://nuloapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NuloApp</a>, Kaloyan realized that many creators in the "faceless YouTube channels" niche were using tools like <a href="http://opus.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opus.pro</a> to generate short-form content from long-form videos, but these tools were very expensive. Without yet earning revenue from YouTube or TikTok, Kaloyan decided to take matters into his own hands, building his own tool in just a month.</p><p>Initially, his tool automatically created and uploaded shorts, but after some time, when his channel didn’t pick up, he stopped the project. Fast forward to a year later, and YouTube's algorithm brought similar content back into his feed, reigniting his passion. This time, Kaloyan took it further by transforming his tool into a SaaS product: NuloApp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-nuloapp-solves"><strong>The Problem NuloApp Solves</strong><a href="#the-problem-nuloapp-solves" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-problem-nuloapp-solves" title="Direct link to the-problem-nuloapp-solves">​</a></h3><p>NuloApp is an AI tool designed to make video content creation simpler by converting long-form videos into short clips that have the highest chance to capture audience’s attention. It resizes content from horizontal (landscape) to vertical (portrait) for platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok, helping creators push content faster.</p><div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tech-stack-overview"><strong>Tech Stack Overview</strong><a href="#tech-stack-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to tech-stack-overview" title="Direct link to tech-stack-overview">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Framework:</strong> Wasp</li><li><strong>Payment integration:</strong> Stripe</li><li><strong>Other tools:</strong> OpenCV, FastAPI, Meta's llama, OpenAI's Whisper, LangChain</li><li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="programatically-editing-videos"><strong>Programatically Editing Videos</strong><a href="#programatically-editing-videos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to programatically-editing-videos" title="Direct link to programatically-editing-videos">​</a></h3><p>The real genius behind NuloApp is the way that Kaloyan combined a number of tools to programatically edit the longer form videos and podcasts, into short, engaging clips for social media. </p><p>First of all, <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenCV</a>, an open-source computer vision library, was used as the main editing tool. This is how NuloApp is able to get the correct aspect ratio for smartphone content, and do other cool things like centering the video on the speaker so that they aren't out of frame when the aspect ratio is changed. </p><p>In order to programtically get the correct clips to extract, AI tools like Meta's <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">llama-3-70b LLM</a> and OpenAI's <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whisper</a> were also used. Whisper allowed for fast speech-to-text transcription, which could then be passed on the llama in order to find segments worth extracting. </p><p>Putting these tools together and accessible via a standalone API was the final step in this process. But this really clever combination of tools was just one part of puzzle. The next problem to solve was how to deliver it all as a SaaS app that users could pay for?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-wasp"><strong>Why Wasp?</strong><a href="#why-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-wasp" title="Direct link to why-wasp">​</a></h3><p>When Kaloyan decided to relaunch his tool as a SaaS product, he didn’t have time to spare. He needed a framework that would allow him to build and deploy quickly. That’s where <strong>Wasp</strong> came in.</p><p>“I was looking for a quick and easy-to-use boilerplate with most SaaS app features already pre-built so I could deploy faster,” says Kaloyan. <a href="https://opensaas.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp’s SaaS boilerplate starter</a>, with well-structured documentation, alongside its responsive Discord support, made it the ideal choice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-impact-of-wasp-on-development"><strong>The Impact of Wasp on Development</strong><a href="#the-impact-of-wasp-on-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-impact-of-wasp-on-development" title="Direct link to the-impact-of-wasp-on-development">​</a></h3><p>Kaloyan was particularly impressed with how Wasp simplified complex tasks that would normally take much longer to implement. From setting up Google logins and dark mode switches to creating hourly jobs, the development process was smoother than expected. “Everything—from enabling Google logins to creating hourly jobs I badly needed—was way too easy to set up.”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="auth-and-stripe-integration-made-easy"><strong>Auth and Stripe Integration Made Easy</strong><a href="#auth-and-stripe-integration-made-easy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to auth-and-stripe-integration-made-easy" title="Direct link to auth-and-stripe-integration-made-easy">​</a></h3><p>One of Kaloyan’s least favorite tasks as a developer is building out authentication systems, and he found that even implementing third-party libraries could be frustrating. Fortunately, Wasp’s boilerplate made the process of setting up authentication and pre-configuring Stripe for payments seamless. </p><p>Here's what <code>wasp.config</code> file looks like, through which you can define full-stack auth in a Wasp app.</p><div class="language-jsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-jsx codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">app myApp </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">wasp</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">version</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"^0.14.0"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">title</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"My App"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token literal-property property" style="color:#36acaa">auth</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">// 1.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="wasps interviewing Tim" src="/assets/images/pg-boss-banner-acb16e71e0ddb7af7590e1be6a252b1a.jpeg" width="1007" height="420" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We’re launching a new series of posts where we'll sit down with the folks who help us run our projects without expecting anyting in return. Yes, we're talking about open-source maintainers and builders, the people who dedicate their free time to make tech better. This is our way to say "Thank you!" to all of those who help us build and improve <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>, as well as shape the webdev ecosystem.</p><p>In our first post, we had the chance to chat with Tim, the maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg-boss</a>, a library that makes managing job queues in PostgreSQL a breeze. We talked about what it’s like to maintain an open-source project, the ups and downs, and why Tim keeps coming back to make pg-boss better. If you’ve ever relied on open-source tools, this series is for you.</p><p>Let's dive in!</p><ul><li><strong>Please tell us a little bit about yourself. When and how did you get introduced to coding?</strong></li></ul><p>I was first introduced to coding in grade school with Logo in the 80s. I built my first website on GeoCities in 97, then started coding professionally with Visual Basic in MS Access during the Y2K craze. I built my first multi-tenant SaaS app (an extranet) in 2002 before it was cool using Classic ASP. I spent at least a decade in C# coding web apps most of the time before finally settling down in the warm embrace of full stack JavaScript with Node.js for the last 10 years.</p><ul><li><strong>Could you introduce us to pg-boss? Was there a reason or use case you had for creating it?</strong></li></ul><p>I joined a startup in 2015 and we needed an open source relational database so Mongo would stop ruining our lives. I had heard good things about Postgres, so I was excited to give it a chance. Our product also included Redis, but only for the purpose of hosting a job queue via the Kue package. This seemed excessive to manage another piece of infrastructure for a queue, especially for our low-volume requirements. I hadn’t used Redis before, so I started researching it.</p><p>I learned that Redis is a great choice when you need a fast, in-memory database. However, a job queue is a different use case, where you are guaranteeing to someone: “I promise to do this later”. If your Redis server crashes, you could lose a lot of jobs with the default configuration. Their persistence documentation even states, “if you want a degree of data safety comparable to what PostgreSQL can provide you”, you should use both RDB and AOF configurations. Within AOF, there is an option, “appendfsync always”, but it’s generally discouraged with warnings of poor performance. The recommended configuration is almost always “everysec”, but with the disclaimer, “you may lose 1 second of data if there is a disaster”. These warnings about safety should cause anyone in technical leadership to pause and ask some questions.</p><p>Even now in 2024 Redis seems to be the dominant queue persistence database in OSS, but it wasn’t designed to match the use case of a guaranteed job delivery system. Seeing the growth of open source Postgres-backed queues makes me optimistic that over time more development teams realize this mismatch and we’ll see a decline in popularity of the Redis queue projects. If your product relies on Redis for its queue, I encourage you to review your disaster recovery plans and server configurations. It’s concerning that the popularity of the “just use Redis for your queue” is likely producing a large population of applications vulnerable to losing jobs.</p><p>In 2015, the number 1 hit on Google for “Postgres job queue” was Brandur Leach’s “Postgres Job Queues &amp; Failure By MVCC” blog post. LOL! The Internet replied with “don’t do this”. However, at this same point in time Postgres 9.5 was in beta and about to be released, and lo and behold a new core feature was added called SKIP LOCKED. This looked like a perfect fit, but it was too new for any packages to have this approach. After a successful prototype, I thought it seemed like a good opportunity to try creating the package myself, since I was new to Node and wanted to learn more about it. I started building it on nights and weekends, shipped version 0.0.1 in early 2016 then finally released 1.0 a year later.</p><ul><li><strong>How do you manage contributions and feature requests?</strong></li></ul><p>The best thing about OSS in my opinion is in its name: “open”. Having the entire world of developers not only use your software, but also be able to read its code and make contributions produces the highest quality code. You will get questions you never thought about, and find bugs you didn’t know existed. In the case of bug fixes, most of the time it’s as simple as making sure said bug has a new unit test then merging a pull request (PR).</p><p>Managing feature requests is not easy, however. If you don’t accept any contributions, it seems to violate the principle of OSS. If you accept every contribution, you risk the project drifting away from its original design or becoming too complicated. The balance between these extremes is evaluating each feature request against what seems to be best aligned with the core purpose of the project. This becomes a non-technical decision sometimes, and may result in a “let’s agree to disagree” outcome. My desire is to try and merge all PRs that arrive, and I really appreciate all the contributors that have sent them. It’s not fun saying “no”, because someone put in the coding effort and they felt strongly enough about it to spend their free time on your project.</p><ul><li><strong>What are the unexpected challenges of managing a successful open-source project?</strong></li></ul><p>I did not expect how time-consuming managing an open source project would be. This is probably the primary reason projects become abandoned over time if they are supported by only 1 or a few developers. For example, you could have a perfectly functioning code base in Node 0.12, then decide to upgrade to async/await later and have to rewrite everything. The same applies to changing a test suite, assertion package, or even striving to attain 100% code coverage.</p><ul><li><strong>Using Postgres as a queue solution has become quite popular recently :) What are your thoughts on differences between pg-boss and e.g. pgmq?</strong></li></ul><p>This is encouraging to see. I learned about pgmq from this question. It looks like a great option for a pure SQL implementation as a Postgres extension. I haven’t used it so I won’t be able to offer a detailed comparison, but after a quick review I see it uses SKIP LOCKED and a partitioned job table, which are good baseline scalability requirements. Postgres extension version management is challenging, however, and usually involves database service restarts and downtime.</p><ul><li><strong>What is the largest scale you’ve seen or heard pg-boss used at? How scalable / how far can you go with running background jobs directly in pg?</strong></li></ul><p>In terms of job storage, we’ve been able to store 2-3 million jobs in v9’s shared job storage and survive, but not really thrive, as database performance starts to degrade. Before v10, in order to mitigate this you have to use configuration settings to move completed jobs into the archive more often.</p><p>Once record counts are under control, in terms of job throughput, the number of concurrent queries to Postgres can be very high, especially when using connection poolers and job batching. I have a speed test in the suite that can both fetch and then complete 10,000 jobs in 0.5 seconds, a metric you would not easily be able to achieve even in some dedicated queuing products. For job creation on the other hand, you have the full power of SQL available in Postgres via INSERT or even COPY.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span><mdxadmonitiontitle>[Fun fact!]</mdxadmonitiontitle></div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Did you know that Wasp uses pg-boss under the hood? We built Wasp Jobs on top of pg-boss, and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's how we did it</a>.</p></div></div><ul><li><strong>While pg-boss has many production use cases, is there a scenario or limit where teams may need a traditional queue instead?</strong></li></ul><p>Because of the limitations in v9, we use pg-boss and AWS SQS side by side. Some of our queues rely heavily on pg-boss’s rate limiting and uniqueness features. We use SQS for queues that can grow very large quickly. Now that we’ve upgraded to v10, we might consider switching back for cost reasons, since SQS is not cheap at this scale.</p><ul><li><strong>There is a new version of <a href="https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss/releases/tag/10.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg-boss v10</a>, what should people be excited about?</strong></li></ul><p>pg-boss v9 and below uses a shared job table across all queues. Once you run into the storage limitations mentioned earlier, all queues are affected. This is especially problematic since queues were also used internally for maintenance and scheduling. Maintenance controls archival, so if this queue can’t be processed, it prevents pg-boss from auto-recovering from this via the retention policy.</p><p>The design goal in v10 was to mitigate this performance issue first by isolating each queue into a dedicated table via partitioning. If a queue were to become backlogged with millions of jobs, it would affect the performance of that queue only. Then, if needed, you could use the newly added deleteJob() function in your workers, inspired by AWS SQS, to keep the record count as low as possible.</p><p>Another very useful new feature is queue policies. Over the years there were several issues opened around worker concurrency, which added several functions and configuration which made the API more complicated and difficult to understand. For example, there was a function sendSingleton(), which behaved entirely different from a configuration option named enforceSingletonQueueActiveLimit. In v10, these were all removed in favor of queue policies. A couple of examples are “short” queues, which only allow 1 pending job, no matter how many jobs are submitted, and “singleton” queues, which allow only 1 job to be active.</p><p>There are several other enhancements made to improve quality of life in v10:</p><ul><li><p>All jobs have 2 retries enabled by default</p></li><li><p>FIPS compliant (dropped internal usage of MD5 hashing)</p></li><li><p>Replication support for HA or read-replicas (every table now has a primary key)</p></li><li><p>Serverless function supervision (maintain() function that can be run from another scheduler)</p></li><li><p>Postgres dependency-free (no pgcrypto extension needed uuid generation)</p></li><li><p>Dead letter queues (Replaces “completion job” feature and gains retry support for processing them)</p></li><li><p><strong>What are your thoughts on things like pg_render <a href="https://www.madewithsupabase.com/p/pg-render" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is a way to render HTML in Postgres</a>? <a href="https://www.madewithsupabase.com/p/pg-render" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Is that going too far?</strong></p></li></ul><p>Since I’m a Postgres fan, it’s hard for me to see how adding more capabilities to it would be considered “going too far”. This particular project appears to be a simple abstraction of other open source packages and could be a useful case study of creating a Postgres extension in Rust. Since this is compiled, it should even have better performance benchmarks over other packages with the same feature in non-compiled languages.</p><p>Overall, I agree with the argument for simplicity in Stephan Schmidt’s article “Just Use Postgres for Everything”. The only issue with his article, which he continues to edit after all these years, is Stephan recommends River, a new OSS queue using SKIP LOCKED in Go, when we could have just mentioned little ole pg-boss that’s been around for years. The irony is that River was built by Brandur “don’t use Postgres queues” Leach. I’m kidding around here, of course, but who doesn’t enjoy a bit of irony?</p><ul><li><strong>What advice would you give to developers or companies who are thinking of open sourcing their projects?</strong></li></ul><p>For developers, I would encourage starting off by making a contribution to a package you use daily. For example, if you’ve ever thought “I like this package, but I think it could be better if it had this feature”, that might be something you could add. If you have an idea of a new project, my advice would be to focus on the MVP (minimally viable product). The more features you add, the more time required to release it and the more maintenance required to keep it running. This is the primary reason I don’t include a web API or UI with pg-boss, even though I’m sure it would make it more popular.</p><p>For companies, I would point to successful startups that became popular and attracted funding because of their OSS projects. TimescaleDB, Supabase, and Citus are examples just from the Postgres ecosystem.</p><ul><li><strong>What is the main reason you keep working on pg-boss? What do you get out of it?</strong></li></ul><p>It’s nice to be able to change what type of development you do occasionally. It gives you a different perspective and usually gives you new insights into your primary job. When you have responsibility over a popular package, it also adds some motivation to make sure it remains healthy. It’s not a good feeling when your package causes bad performance on a database server because of its own success (a large queue backlog could mean your company is growing). I did sign up for GitHub Sponsors a couple years ago, and I appreciate every company and developer that has benefited from pg-boss making contributions, but it’s still far from being able to fund itself.</p><ul><li><strong>Have you ever thought of introducing a paid product on top of pg-boss? Why yes/no?</strong></li></ul><p>I haven’t spent time evaluating what that would look like, but it is an intriguing idea for sure. If I was able to work on pg-boss full-time, there are several potential new concepts that could be explored now that partitioning and queue policies have been created.</p><p>For example, someone recently opened an issue to request arbitrary JSON querying capability to be included in fetch(). If done globally across all queues, this would require indexing the jsonb payload, which in some cases could be large, slowing down reads and writes. However, if applied only to a single partition, this index could be isolated to only the queue that needs it via a new policy. Postgres allows different indexes and unique constraints between tables within the same partitioning hierarchy, which could be used for this policy.</p><p>Furthermore, very large partitions could even have subpartitions, creating a tree-like structure for scalability purposes. This strategy has already been proven at scale in Postgres by the TimescaleDB team, and could potentially result in removing its storage capacity challenges entirely.</p><p>Yet another area of exploration is encapsulating all features into Postgres functions to make the logic of pg-boss more easily integrated with non-Node.js platforms, as most of the logic in pg-boss is actually already pure SQL. Some have also mentioned to me that it would be nice if we had a standard queue data schema that could be shared across platforms, which sounds like a noble goal, but challenging since it would involve collaboration across OSS projects to complete.</p><ul><li><strong>Apart from yours, is there an open source tool or project you’re particularly excited about?</strong></li></ul><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://supabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase</a> at the moment. I’m currently evaluating their use of JWT claims and Postgres RLS for SaaS multi-tenancy. They have open sourced several of their projects as well, such as supavisor, a connection pooler. Their product also happens to use pg-boss internally, which means… “they use pg-boss btw” 🙂</p>]]></content:encoded>

I wanted to make the jump and learn some frontend for a full stack app. I quickly experienced the arduous nature of a React-with-Django project and thought the pain was just part of the development process. However, I came across a very cool new full stack framework called <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>. </p><p>Wasp is an amazing dev tool for full stack applications. Combining things like React, Node.js and Prisma, Wasp allows for development to be expedited in ways never before seen.</p><p>In this article, I am going to walk through creating a full stack application in Django versus Wasp to prove the simplicity of Wasp against a very conventional full-stack technology. I am also going to make a React frontend connected to Django. The point is to highlight the inefficiencies, difficulties, and issues that can (and will) arise with Django/React that are made vastly simpler when working with Wasp.</p><p>This article is not intended as a how-to, but I do provide code snippets to give you a feel for their differences. Also note that in order to give a side-by-side comparison, I'll use tabs which you can switch back and forth between, like this:</p><div class="tabs-container tabList__CuJ"><ul role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal" class="tabs"><li role="tab" tabindex="0" aria-selected="true" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP tabs__item--active">Django 🟢</li><li role="tab" tabindex="-1" aria-selected="false" class="tabs__item tabItem_LNqP">Wasp 🐝</li></ul><div class="margin-top--md"><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6">Django info will go here...</div><div role="tabpanel" class="tabItem_Ymn6" hidden="">...and the Wasp comparison here.</div></div></div><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Let's get started" src="https://i.giphy.com/BpGWitbFZflfSUYuZ9.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-1-let-there-be-light">Part 1: Let There Be Light!<a href="#part-1-let-there-be-light" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Part 1: Let There Be Light!" title="Direct link to Part 1: Let There Be Light!">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-create-some-projects-and-set-things-up">Let’s create some projects and set things up<a href="#lets-create-some-projects-and-set-things-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let’s create some projects and set things up" title="Direct link to Let’s create some projects and set things up">​</a></h3><p>This part is about the only part where there is significant overlap between Django and Wasp.

You need to create a <code>urls.py</code> file and direct your specific views file and functions to a route. Those app urls are then connected to the project urls. Phew.</li><li>Wasp’s way: define a route and direct it to a component.</li></ul><div class="tabs-container tabList__CuJ"><ul role="tablist" aria-orientation="horizontal" class="tabs"><li role="tab"

configured for you. At this point we can create some React components, and then import and call these operations from the client. That is not the case with Django, unfortunately there is still a lot we need to do to configure React in our app and get things working together, which we will look at below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-2-so-you-want-to-use-react-with-django">Part 2: So you want to use React with Django?<a href="#part-2-so-you-want-to-use-react-with-django" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Part 2: So you want to use React with Django?" title="Direct link to Part 2: So you want to use React with Django?">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="React with Django is... hard" src="https://i.giphy.com/LOVMoi1qYWJyw.webp"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>At this point we could just create a simple client with HTML and CSS to go with our Django app, but then this wouldn't be a fair comparison, as Wasp is a true full-stack framework and gives you a managed React-NodeJS-Prisma app out-of-the-box.

how much easier it is to call the server-side code via Wasp operations. Plus, Wasp gives you the added benefit of refreshing the client-side cache for the Entity that's referenced in the operation definition (in this case <code>Task</code>). And the cherry on top is how easy it is to pass the authenticated user to the component, something we haven't even touched on in the Django app, and which we will talk about more below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="part-3-auth-with-django-no-way-josé">Part 3: Auth with Django?

On the other hand, the Django implementation is so long and complicated I'm not going to even bother showing you the code and I'll just list out the stps instead.

href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/auth/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auth with Wasp</a>! But that's just one example, you can also add other auth methods easily, like <code>google: {}</code>, <code>gitHub: {}</code> and <code>discord: {}</code> social auth, after configuring the apps and adding your environment variables. </p><p>Wasp allows you to get building without worrying about so many things. I don’t need to worry about password hashing, multiple projects and apps, CORS headers, etc. I just need to add a couple lines of code. </p><p><strong>Wasp just makes sense.</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-final-thing">One Final Thing<a href="#one-final-thing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to One Final Thing" title="Direct link to One Final Thing">​</a></h2><p>I just want to highlight one more aspect of Wasp that I really love. In Django, we're completely responsible for dealing with all the boilerplate code when setting up a new app. In other words, we have to set up new apps from scratch every time (even if it's been done before a million times by us and other devs). But with Wasp we can scaffold a new app template in a number of ways to <em>really</em> jump start the development process. </p><p>Let's check out these other ways to get a full-stack app started in Wasp.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="way-1-straight-outta-terminal">Way #1: Straight Outta Terminal<a href="#way-1-straight-outta-terminal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Way #1: Straight Outta Terminal" title="Direct link to Way #1: Straight Outta Terminal">​</a></h3><p>A simple <strong>wasp new</strong>  in the terminal shows numerous starting options and app templates. If I really want to make a todo app for example, well there you have it, option 2. </p><p>Right out of the box you have a to-do application with authentication, CRUD functionality, and some basic styling. All of this is ready to be amended for your specific use case. </p><p>Or what if you want to turn code into money? Well, you can also get a <a href="https://opensaas.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully functioning SaaS app</a>. Interested in the latest AI offereings?

In this post, I will share my personal experience using Lucia - a modern, framework-agnostic authentication library that has been getting, deservedly so, a lot of love from the community in recent months.</p><p>First, I will demonstrate how you can implement it within your Next.js application through a step-by-step guide you can follow. It will require a fair amount of code and configuration, but the process itself is quite straightforward.</p><p>Secondly, we’ll see how to achieve the same with <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> in just a few lines of code. Wasp is a batteries-included, full-stack framework for React &amp; Node.js that uses Lucia under the hood to implement authentication.

For instance, <a href="https://clerk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clerk</a> offers a paid service, while <a href="https://next-auth.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextAuth.js</a> is an open-source solution alongside <a href="https://lucia-auth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia</a>, which has become quite popular recently. </p><p>These tools provide robust features, but committing to third-party services — which not only adds another layer of complexity but also have paid tiers you have to keep an eye on — might be an overkill for a small project. In-house solutions keep things centralized but leave it to a developer to implement some of the mentioned features.</p><p>In our case, Lucia has proved to be a perfect middle ground - it’s not a third-party service and does not require a dedicated infrastructure, but it also provides a very solid foundation that’s easy to build upon.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into a step-by-step guide on how to implement your own authentication with Next.js and Lucia.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-setting-up-nextjs">Step 1: Setting up Next.js<a href="#step-1-setting-up-nextjs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Setting up Next.js" title="Direct link to Step 1: Setting up Next.js">​</a></h3><p>First, create a new Next.js project:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span><span class="token plain"> my-nextjs-app</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">npm</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-install-lucia">Step 2: Install Lucia<a href="#step-2-install-lucia" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Install Lucia" title="Direct link to Step 2: Install Lucia">​</a></h3><p>Next, install Lucia:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">npm</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><span class="token plain"> lucia</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-3-set-up-authentication">Step 3: Set up Authentication<a href="#step-3-set-up-authentication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Set up Authentication" title="Direct link to Step 3: Set up Authentication">​</a></h3><p>Create an <code>auth</code> file in your project and add the necessary files for Lucia to be imported and initialized.

Well, not really. </p><p>Let’s recap which steps were necessary to actually make this happen:</p><ul><li>Set up your app.</li><li>Add Lucia.</li><li>Set up authentication.</li><li>Add User to DB.</li><li>Obtain GitHub OAuth credentials and configure your environment variables.</li><li>Create some util functions.</li><li>Add Login and Sign up routes, with custom made components.</li><li>Finally, create a protected route.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/3ofSBnYbEPePeigIMg/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6x77sivlvr6hs2yu5aztvwjvhgugv6b718mjanr2h&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media2.giphy.com/media/3ofSBnYbEPePeigIMg/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6x77sivlvr6hs2yu5aztvwjvhgugv6b718mjanr2h&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Honestly, when trying to create something cool <strong>FAST</strong>, repeating these steps and debugging a few logical problems here and there that always occur can feel a little bit frustrating. Soon, we’ll take a look at Wasp’s approach to solving that same problem and we’ll be able to compare how much easier Wasp’s auth implementation process is.</p><p>In case you want to check the whole code for this part, <a href="https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/tree/main/nextjs-app/github-oauth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia has an example repo</a> (that is the source of most of the code shown), so, you can check it out if you’d like.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wasp-implementation">Wasp Implementation<a href="#wasp-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wasp Implementation" title="Direct link to Wasp Implementation">​</a></h2><p>Now, let’s go through how we can achieve the same things with Wasp 🐝. Although it still uses Lucia in the background, Wasp takes care of all the heavy-lifting for you, making the process much quicker and simpler. Let’s check out the developer experience for ourselves.</p><p>Before we just into it, in case you’re more of a visual learner, here’s a 1-minute video showcasing auth with wasp.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qiro77q-ulI?si=JVBcFAk5dnR3Q0PL" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></div><p>As seen in the video, Wasp is a framework for building apps with the benefits of using a configuration file to make development easier. It handles many repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on creating unique features. In this tutorial, we’ll also learn more about the Wasp config file and see how it makes setting up authentication simpler.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"

different stuff from actually sending the emails, to generating the verification tokens and more. They reference this <a href="https://lucia-auth.com/guides/email-and-password/email-verification-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, but again, Wasp’s Auth makes the whole process way easier, handling a bunch of the complexity for us while also giving a bunch of other UI components, ready to use, to ease the UI details (e.g. <code>VerifyEmailForm</code>, <code>ForgotPasswordForm</code> and, <code>ResetPasswordForm</code>).</p><p>The whole point here is the difference in time and developer experience in order to implement the same scenarios. For the Next.js project with Lucia, you will spend at least a few hours implementing everything if you’re going all by yourself. That same experience translates to no more than 1 hour with Wasp. What to do with the rest of the time? <strong>Implement the important stuff your particular business requires!</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-show-us-your-support">Can you show us your support?<a href="#can-you-show-us-your-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can you show us your support?" title="Direct link to Can you show us your support?">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/l0MYAs5E2oIDCq9So/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6l6i66eq1dc7i5rz05nkl4mgjltyv206syb0o304g&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media2.giphy.com/media/l0MYAs5E2oIDCq9So/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6l6i66eq1dc7i5rz05nkl4mgjltyv206syb0o304g&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Are you interested in more content like this?

This can be especially beneficial for small teams or individual developers aiming to launch products quickly.</p><p>Of course, generally when we talk abstractions, it always comes with the downside of losing the finesse of a more personal implementation. In this case, Wasp provides a bunch of stuff for you to implement around and uses Lucia on the background, so the scenario where there’s a mismatch of content implementation is highly unlikable to happen.</p><p>In summary, while implementing your own authentication with Next.js and Lucia provides complete control and customization, it can be complex and time-consuming. On the other hand, using a solution like Wasp simplifies the process, reduces code length, and speeds up development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Launch Week 6 is here" src="/img/lw6/lw6-banner.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Bonjour Wasp connoisseurs 🐝 👋,</p><p>It's been a while, but we're back! We've been busy wasps and put our antennae down to work to deliver you v0.14, which is happening <a href="https://discord.gg/aMvmMaa5?event=1261263045741510687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in exactly two days, on July 17th</a>!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="It's happening!" src="/img/lw6/its-happening.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>To reserve your spot (we can fit only so many people in our Discord), click <a href="https://discord.gg/aMvmMaa5?event=1261263045741510687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Join the kick-off event" src="/img/lw6/lw6-join-kickoff.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Once you see the invite, mark yourself as "Interested," and that's it (don't make us talk to ourselves again)! Also, if you thought you'd slip by without a bad joke, you were direly wrong:</p><blockquote><p>Why do wasps never leave tips? Because they are stingy.</p><p>🤯🤯🤯</p></blockquote><p>Okay, now to the fun stuff—let's see what we're packing into this upcoming release!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1--define-your-data-models-in-a-separate-prismaschema-file">#1: 📝 Define your data models in a separate prisma.schema file!<a href="#1--define-your-data-models-in-a-separate-prismaschema-file" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #1: 📝 Define your data models in a separate prisma.schema file!" title="Direct link to #1: 📝 Define your data models in a separate prisma.schema file!">​</a></h2><p>This change marks the beginning of one of our most requested features - splitting your Wasp config into multiple files! We know that as you develop your Wasp app and it grows, it can become unwieldy to have everything in one hefty .wasp file.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Define data models in prisma.schema file" src="/img/lw6/prisma-split.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>That's why we started by extracting the data model definitions into a standalone Prisma schema file! This will significantly reduce the size of the Wasp config file and also allow for <strong>a more streamlined experience of writing PSL (Prisma Schema Language), with all the goodies like syntax highlighting and auto-completion working out of the box 🎉</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2--auth-hooks---onbeforesignup-onaftersignup-and-more">#2: 🔒 Auth Hooks - onBeforeSignup, onAfterSignup, and more!<a href="#2--auth-hooks---onbeforesignup-onaftersignup-and-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #2: 🔒 Auth Hooks - onBeforeSignup, onAfterSignup, and more!" title="Direct link to #2: 🔒 Auth Hooks - onBeforeSignup, onAfterSignup, and more!">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Auth lifecycle hooks" src="/img/lw6/auth-hooks.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Although Wasp's Auth feature is probably the fastest way to get authentication running in your full-stack app, <strong>adding your custom logic to the auth process can also be quite handy—e.g. if you want to log something, do some extra config etc</strong>.</p><p>We've made that easy, by offering several authentication lifecycle hooks that you can use for the exact purpose!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3--new-authentication-provider-discord">#3: 🆕 New authentication provider: Discord!<a href="#3--new-authentication-provider-discord" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #3: 🆕 New authentication provider: Discord!" title="Direct link to #3: 🆕 New authentication provider: Discord!">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Discord as a new auth provider" src="/img/lw6/auth-discord.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>This one is pretty self-explanatory, but that doesn't make it any less cool! Besides Google and GitHub, <strong>Discord is now a third social auth method natively supported by Wasp, next to Google and GitHub</strong> - that means all you need to do is define a single line in your Wasp config, and voilà - your users can now sign in with Discord!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4--typescript-sdk-rfc---a-sneak-peek">#4: 👀 TypeScript SDK RFC - a sneak peek!<a href="#4--typescript-sdk-rfc---a-sneak-peek" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to #4: 👀 TypeScript SDK RFC - a sneak peek!" title="Direct link to #4: 👀 TypeScript SDK RFC - a sneak peek!">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="TS SDK proposal of code" src="/img/lw6/ts-sdk.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>As you might have seen in the community, this has been an ongoing topic of discussion for a while. Although having a dedicated configuration language (DSL) allows for the maximum customizability of the DX, <strong>having Wasp config in TypeScript instead will help out with language tooling (IDE syntax highlighting and auto-completion). Also, it might feel even more familiar to developers using Wasp</strong>.</p><p>This is why we decided to test the waters and see how we (and you) like it! We are still working out what it will look like, and we have laid out some of the ideas in this <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/RFC-TypeScript-DSL-Design-ec5d8c80bffe4fa19537ec659caf5b67" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC for TS SDK</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the release of ChatGPT, we’ve been flooded with all possible versions of apps that use it in one way or another. Building on top of trendy technology is an excellent way to get initial attention, but still, 99% of these apps die very quickly and don’t last beyond a week or two following their “big” Twitter or Product Hunt launch.</p><p>Why? <strong>Because they aren’t solving a real problem</strong>. It’s either a fun tech gadget or a gross overpromise (e.g., <em>“you will never need to code again,”</em> which <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I strongly disagree with</a>) that quickly falls short.</p><p>Building a successful product still follows the same rules as in the pre-GPT era: <strong>find a problem people are willing to pay for and then figure out a way to reach these people</strong>. Sounds simple? It is, but it for sure isn’t easy. The good news is that GPT opened so many new opportunities that actually doing it is faster and easier than ever.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-the-hero-of-our-story---max-">Meet the hero of our story - Max! 🦸<a href="#meet-the-hero-of-our-story---max-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet the hero of our story - Max! 🦸" title="Direct link to Meet the hero of our story - Max! 🦸">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rowl3gqdrb2nhhdl1hyo.gif" alt="our-hero-max" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The hero of our story today is Max, a software engineer at Red Hat. He built <a href="https://description-generator.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://description-generator.online</a> (an AI description generator for Etsy products) and sold it on <a href="http://acquire.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquire.com</a>. A senior backend engineer by day and a serial hacker and tinkerer by night, Max always had a passion for building products, and GPT was the last piece of the puzzle he was waiting for.</p><p>Read on to learn how he went through the entire cycle of finding a problem, building a solution, getting customers, and ultimately selling his app in 5 months total.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-1-look-for-problems-in-unusual-places-️️">Lesson #1: Look for problems in “unusual” places 🕵️‍♂️<a href="#lesson-1-look-for-problems-in-unusual-places-️️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lesson #1: Look for problems in “unusual” places 🕵️‍♂️" title="Direct link to Lesson #1: Look for problems in “unusual” places 🕵️‍♂️">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kz3nsmm5zheyjukvr6j8.gif" alt="Looking for problems" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TL;DR: Talk to your friends who aren’t developers! Learn about their problems and offer help. The more unfamiliar and disconnected from tech their occupation is, the better - these are gold mines for GPT-powered solutions!</em></p><p>It all started with Max’s friend who owns an Etsy marketplace - she needed help with some data/workflow automation, and Max agreed to lend a hand. Consequently, he also started hanging out in the Ukranian Etsy community on Slack.</p><p>Soon, he learned that one of the most common requests there is for help with writing product descriptions (”listings”) in English. Although most members used English daily and had no problem communicating, writing high-quality, compelling, and professional-sounding listings was still a challenge. Auto-translation services still weren’t sophisticated enough, and hiring native English speakers was too expensive for most.</p><p>This sounded like a real, glaring problem directly connected to the number of items Etsy sellers sell and, thus, the profit they make. As it turned out, it was the case.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-2-build-a-prototype-fast-️">Lesson #2: Build a prototype, fast 🏎️<a href="#lesson-2-build-a-prototype-fast-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lesson #2: Build a prototype, fast 🏎️" title="Direct link to Lesson #2: Build a prototype, fast 🏎️">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ign7kz6464wnuac13y8.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TL;DR: Speed is the name of the game here. Don’t spend time flexing on your stack and optimizing to the last byte. Pick something that works and ship it!</em></p><p>The problem of writing convincing product listings in English caught Max’s attention. He was aware of ChatGPT and how useful it could be for this. However, being a backend engineer with limited frontend experience, building a full-stack app around it and choosing and configuring all parts of the stack himself sounded daunting and laborious. It wasn’t until he came across <a href="https://opensaas.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open SaaS</a> that he felt ready to take action.</p><p>The prototype was ready after a couple of days, and Max immediately shared it with his Etsy community.  He kept it extremely simple - no landing page or any copy at all (just a form to enter your product details), even no custom domain yet, but myProduct.fly.io you get assigned upon deploying to Fly (which takes just a single CLI command with Wasp).</p><p>And that was enough - as his product scratched the itch Etsy sellers repeatedly mentioned, the reception was overwhelmingly positive! In just a few days, Max got 400 signups, and several hundred product listings were generated daily.</p><hr><p>By the way, if you’re looking for an easy, low maintenance way to start your next side project, check out <a href="https://opensaas.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open SaaS</a>, a 100% free, open-source Saas Starter! </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sf1fhsgwuurkre9a7drq.png" alt="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sf1fhsgwuurkre9a7drq.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Open SaaS is a feature-rich, React + NodeJS SaaS template, with Stripe, OpenAI / GPT app examples, AWS S3 file upload, Analytics, Admin Dashboard, and full Documentation!</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-3-test-willingness-to-pay-early-">Lesson #3: Test willingness to pay early 💸<a href="#lesson-3-test-willingness-to-pay-early-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lesson #3: Test willingness to pay early 💸" title="Direct link to Lesson #3: Test willingness to pay early 💸">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v6rcbozh1euokgyvgv1g.gif" alt="money please" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TL;DR: People signing up for your product is amazing, but convincing them to pay is a completely separate game. If you want to ensure your solution brings real value and you’re not wasting time, find a way to test monetizing as early as possible.</em></p><p>Max saw the adoption picking up, which made him ask himself <em>“How do I turn this into a business? What would users be willing to pay for?”</em> After all, he had his own expenses, like server costs and GPT API subscription.</p><p>Looking at how users use the product, he quickly realized he could make generating descriptions even easier - a seller could upload the image of a product, and that’s it; the full product description can be generated directly from it. That was a good candidate for a “premium” feature, since it was an upgrade on top of the basic functionality.</p><p>Max added the feature, and soon enough, the first customers started rolling in! 💰</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-4-keep-building-or-sell-how-to-decide-">Lesson #4: Keep building or sell?

Still, soon, it became apparent that the Etsy community Max was part of had its limits. Although all non-English speaking markets shared the problem, which made for a big opportunity, reaching them and setting up and executing a sales process would still take time and effort.</p><p>On the other hand, competing products started appearing. Although super valuable for Etsy sellers, if Max built the product in a week, others could do it too. It started becoming clear that the value of the business would soon start moving from the technical solution to sales, support, and customer experience.</p><p>Being a hacker at heart and not so personally invested in arts &amp; crafts marketplaces, Max decided to sell the product to somebody who is. He listed the description generator on&nbsp;<a href="https://acquire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://acquire.com/</a>, along with the usage metrics and relevant data, and soon started receiving offers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lesson-5-provide-support-during-acquisition-">Lesson #5: Provide support during acquisition 🤝<a href="#lesson-5-provide-support-during-acquisition-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lesson #5: Provide support during acquisition 🤝" title="Direct link to Lesson #5: Provide support during acquisition 🤝">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i6ay41rsjabkv9mkqcto.gif" alt="got my back" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>TL;DR:&nbsp;Selling your product takes more than finding a buyer.

Since the buyer was taking over everything - the source code, domain, and customers, Max providing 3-month support with the transition was an essential part of the deal.</p><p>Also, since they couldn’t use an escrow service due to some technical and geographical limitations, they agreed on splitting the payment 50/50 - half in the beginning and another half when the migration was over. Max made sure his customers had a flawless experience with moving everything over, resulting in a great relationship mutually filled with trust. Besides selling your app, making friends is an underrated bonus! 😎</p><p>After a few months, the deal has been reached!&nbsp;<a href="http://description-generator.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Description-generator.online</a>&nbsp;got a new owner, an expert in the industry willing to expand to new markets, and Max got his first exit and could move on to the next exciting project!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l6zioe34s0u9ic80g26k.gif" alt="michael summary" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That’s it!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="javascripts-need-for-a-full-stack-framework">JavaScript's Need for a Full-stack Framework<a href="#javascripts-need-for-a-full-stack-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JavaScript's Need for a Full-stack Framework" title="Direct link to JavaScript's Need for a Full-stack Framework">​</a></h2><p>“<em>Why Don't We Have A Laravel For JavaScript?”.</em> This is the question <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaodD79Q4iE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theo poses in his most recent video</a>. </p><p>And if you’re not familiar with tools like <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laravel</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby-on-Rails</a>, they are opinionated full-stack frameworks (for PHP and Ruby) with lots of built-in features that follow established conventions so that developers can write less boilerplate and more business logic, while getting the industry best practices baked into their app.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dndfaz2hjet9nisbiimc.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>He answers this question with the opinion that JavaScript <em>doesn’t need</em> such frameworks because it’s better to select the tools you want and build the solution you need yourself.</p><p>This sounds great — and it also happens to be a nice flex if you’re a seasoned dev — but I feel that he doesn’t back up this claim very well, and <strong>I’m here to tell you where I think he’s wrong</strong>.</p><p>In my opinion, the better question to ask is why don’t we have a Laravel for JavaScript <em>yet</em>? The answer being that we’re still working on it.</p><p>In his summary of the full-stack frameworks of the JavaScript world that could be comparable to Laravel or Rails, he fails to consider a few important points:</p><ol><li><strong>People really want a Laravel / Rails for JavaScript</strong>. If they didn’t, there wouldn’t be so many attempts to create one, and he wouldn’t be making a video whose sole purpose is to respond to the pleading cry “<em>WHY DOESN’T JAVASCRIPT HAVE ITS OWN LARAVEL!?</em>”</li><li><strong>He fails to consider the timing and maturity of the underlying tools within the JS ecosystem</strong>. Perhaps it’s not that a Laravel for JavaScript doesn’t <em>need</em> to exist, it’s just that it doesn’t exist yet due to some major differences in the ecosystems themselves, like how old they are and where the innovation is mostly happening.</li><li><strong>He also fails to ask for whom these types of solutions are suitable for</strong>. Surely, not all devs have the same objectives, so some might opt for the composable approach while others prefer to reach for a framework.</li></ol><p>So let’s take a look at how we got to the point we’re at today, and how we might be able to bring a full-stack framework like Laravel or Rails to the world of JavaScript.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-shit-done">Getting Shit Done<a href="#getting-shit-done" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Shit Done" title="Direct link to Getting Shit Done">​</a></h2><p>In his video, Theo brings up the point that "<em>there's a common saying in the React world now which is that ‘if you're not using a framework you're building one’”.</em> Even though this is meant to be used as a criticism, Theo feels that most JavaScript devs are missing the point and that building your “own framework” is actually an advantage. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q5ft5f1j2zemurcvvzzk.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>He feels that the modular nature of the JavaScript ecosystem is a huge advantage, but that sounds like a lot of pressure on the average developer to make unnecessary judgement calls and manage lots of boilerplate code.</p><p>Sure, you have teams that need to innovate and meet the needs of special use cases. These are the ones that prioritize modularity. They tweak, improve, and squeeze as much out of developer experience (DX) and performance as possible to get their unique job done right.</p><p>But on the other hand, there are also numerous teams whose main objective is producing value and innovating on the side of the product they are building, instead of the tools they are using to build it. These devs will favor a framework that allows them to focus solely on the business logic. This gives them a stable way to build stuff with best practices so they can easily advance from one project to another. In this camp are also the lean, mean indiehackers looking for frameworks so they can move fast and get ideas to market!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/21tanpp8rmrboal0jl57.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It’s a bit like the difference between Mac and Linux. Mac’s unified stack that just works out-of-the box means many professionals prefer it for its productivity, whereas Linux is great if you’re looking for flexibility and have the time and knowledge to tweak it to your desires. Both are valid solutions that can coexist to meet different needs.</p><p>This focus on productivity is what made Rails so powerful back in the day, and why Laravel is such a loved framework at the moment. And the many attempts at creating such a framework for JavaScript is proof enough that there is a large subset of JavaScript devs who also want such a solution. </p><p>But maybe the reason such a framework doesn’t exist yet doesn’t have to do with whether devs want one or not, but rather the important factors which are needed in order for such a framework to come together haven’t aligned up until this point. For such a framework to be widely adoptable, it first needs underlying technologies that are stable enough to build upon. After that, it needs time and many iteration cycles to reach maturity itself, so that devs can feel comfortable adopting it.   </p><p>Have these factors aligned in the JavaScript world to give us the type of frameworks that PHP and Ruby already have? Maybe not quite yet, but they do seem to be slowly coming together.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comparing-ecosystems">Comparing Ecosystems<a href="#comparing-ecosystems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comparing Ecosystems" title="Direct link to Comparing Ecosystems">​</a></h2><p>One of Theo’s main points is that JavaScript as a language enables a level of modularity and composability that languages like Ruby and PHP don’t, which is why Ruby and PHP ecosystems are well served by full-stack frameworks, but JavaScript <em>doesn’t need one</em> since you can just compose stuff on your own.</p><p>While JavaScript is a peculiar language, with its support for both functional and imperative paradigms and dynamic nature, it also comes with a lot of pitfalls (although it has improved quite a bit lately), so you don’t typically hear it get praised in the way Theo does here. In fact, you are probably more likely to hear praise for Ruby and its properties as a modular and flexible language.</p><p>So if it isn’t some unique properties of JavaScript as a language that make it the king of web dev, what is it then?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r051nlojgrvt9crc03jd.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Well, the answer is pretty simple: <strong>JavaScript is the language of the browser</strong>.</p><p><em>Way back</em> when most of the web development was happening on the server side, PHP, Java, Ruby and other languages where reigning supreme. During this era, devs would only write small pieces of functionality in JavaScript, because most of the work was being handled server-side.</p><p>But as web development evolved and we started building richer applications, with more dynamic, responsive, and real-time features, a lot of code moved away from the server and over towards JavaScript on the client, because it’s (basically) the only language that supports this. So instead of doing your development mostly in PHP or Ruby with a little bit of JavaScript sprinkled in there, you were now splitting your apps between substantial amounts of JavaScript on the client, plus Ruby or PHP on the server.</p><p>JavaScript’s final power move came with the arrival of NodeJS and the ability to also write it on the server, which secured its position as the king of web dev languages. Today, devs can (and do) write their entire apps in JavaScript. This means you need to know one language less, while you’re also able to share the code between front-end and back-end. This has opened up a way for better integration between front-end and back-end, which has snowballed into the ecosystem we know today.</p><p>So it’s not so much the unique properties of JavaScript as a language that have made it the dominant ecosystem for web development, but more its unique monopoly as the only language that can be used to write client code, plus it can also be used server-side.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ulc5eo5qu3a0nuv6bnv5.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As Theo says, “<em>we’ve got infinitely more people making awesome solutions</em>” in the JavaScript ecosystem. That’s right. It’s exactly those infinite number of developers working in the space creating the flexibility and modular solutions for JavaScript, rather than it being an innate quality of the programming language.</p><p>And because the JavaScript ecosystem is still the hottest one around, it has the most devs in total while continuing to attract new ones every day. This means that we get a large, diverse community doing two main things:</p><ol><li>Innovating</li><li>Building</li></ol><p>The innovators (and influencers) tend to be the loudest, and as a result opinion largely skews in their favor. But there is also a lot of building, or “normal” usage, happening! It’s just that the innovators tend to do the talking on behalf of the builders.</p><p>So with all that’s going on in the JavaScript ecosystem, is it pointless to try and build a lasting framework for JavaScript developers, as Theo suggests, or are we on the path towards achieving this goal regardless of what the innovators might claim?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="show-me-what-youre-working-with">Show Me What You’re Working With<a href="#show-me-what-youre-working-with" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Show Me What You’re Working With" title="Direct link to Show Me What You’re Working With">​</a></h2><p>Theo also drops the names of a bunch of current JavaScript frameworks that have either failed to take off, or “<em>just can’t seem to get it right</em>” when it comes to being a comprehensive full-stack solution.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/susa9icldz2hzysqo1qm.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And he does have a point here. So far, solutions like <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>, <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redwood</a>, <a href="https://adonisjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adonis</a>, or <a href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T3</a> haven’t managed to secure the popularity in their ecosystem that Rails or Laravel have in theirs.</p><p><strong>But these things take time.</strong></p><p>Have a look at the graph above. Laravel and Rails have been around for 13-15 years! The JavaScript frameworks being used in comparison are just getting started, with some of them, like <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> and <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redwood</a>, at similar stages in their development as Laravel and Rails were during their initial years.</p><p>As you can see, it takes time for good solutions to reach maturity. And even with some of these frameworks starting to stagnate their great initial growth is evidence that demand for these tools definitely exists! </p><p>The main overlying issue that tends to plague these tools is that Javascript as an ecosystem is moving quite fast, so for a solution like this to survive long term, it needs to not only be opinionated enough, but also modular enough to keep up with the shifts in the ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/biqe18hoeb6d06ughjhh.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>One factor that prevents frameworks from reaching this state is being tied too tightly to the wrong technology. This was NextJS for BlitzJS, GraphQL for Redwood, and Blaze for MeteorJS. And another factor is <em>not going big enough</em> with the framework, because it seems too daunting a task within the JavaScript ecosystem, where things move fast and everyone is “terrified of being opinionated” because they might get criticized by the loudest voices in the scene. </p><p>In other words, frameworks that avoid going big on their own, and going <em>truly</em> full-stack, like Ruby-on-Rails and Laravel went, miss the opportunity to solve the most common pain-points that continue to plague JavaScript developers.</p><p>But, the JavaScript ecosystem is maturing and stabilizing, we are learning from previous attempts, and there <em>will</em> be a full-stack framework bold enough to go all the way in, get enough things right, and persist for long enough to secure its place.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="say-hi-to-wasp">Say Hi to Wasp<a href="#say-hi-to-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Say Hi to Wasp" title="Direct link to Say Hi to Wasp">​</a></h2><p>In his comparison of JavaScript frameworks on the market today, Theo also fails to mention the full-stack framework for React &amp; NodeJS that we’re currently working on, <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>.</p><p>We’ve been working hard on <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> to be the <em>truly</em> full-stack framework that meets the demands of web developers and fills that void in the JavaScript ecosystem to become the framework they love to use. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z7j67hychqw770nrau3f.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>With Wasp, we decided to go big, opinionated, and truly full-stack</strong>. In other words, we’re going <em>all in</em> with this framework.</p><p>That means thinking from first principles and designing a novel approach that only Wasp uses, like building our own compiler for our configuration language, and truly going full-stack, while also keeping it modular enough to move together with the ecosystem as it progresses.</p><p>This means that we spent more time in the beginning trying different approaches and building the foundation, which finally brought us a significant jump in usage starting in late 2023. Wasp is now growing strong, and at a really fast pace!</p><p>It’s really cool for us to see Wasp being used today to ship tons of new apps and businesses, and even being used internally by some big names and organizations (more info on that will be officially released soon)!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1eo9feum42heb2qcua9o.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>What Wasp does differently than other full-stack frameworks in the JavaScript world is that it separates it’s main layer of abstraction into its own configuration file, <code>main.wasp</code>. This config file gives Wasp the knowledge it needs to take care of a lot of the boilerplatey, infrastructure-focused code, and allows it to have this unique initial compile-time step where it is able to reason about your web app before it generates the code for it in the background (using that knowledge while generating it).</p><p>In practice, this means that all you have to do is describe your Wasp app at a high level in Wasp’s config file, and then implement everything else in technologies that you’re familiar with such as React, NodeJS, and Prisma. It also means that Wasp has a high modularity potential, meaning we are building it to also support other frontend frameworks in the future, like Vue, Solid or Svelte, and to even support additional back-end languages, like Python, Go or Rust.</p><p>If you’re the kind of developer that wishes a Rails or Laravel for JavaScript existed, then you should <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give Wasp a try</a> (and then <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head into our Discord</a> and let us know what you think)!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-we-headed">Where Are We Headed?<a href="#where-are-we-headed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where Are We Headed?" title="Direct link to Where Are We Headed?">​</a></h2><p>We firmly believe that there will be a full-stack framework for JavaScript as there is Laravel for PHP and Ruby-on-Rails for Ruby.</p><p>It just seems like, at the moment, that we’re still working towards it. It also seems very likely that we will get there soon, given the popularity of current meta-frameworks and stacks like NextJS and T3. </p><p>But this stuff takes time, and patience.</p><p>Plus, you have to be bold enough to try something new, knowing you will get criticized for your work by some of the loudest voices in the ecosystem.</p><p>That’s what we’re prepared for and why we’re going <em>all in</em> with Wasp.</p><p>See you there!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nig9t4pr85jqtz536frn.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

I was able to switch from education to web development by learning and building in my free time, participating in hackathons, and creating educational content for devs.</p><p>Back when I was finding my first dev job, although I was determined to become a staff engineer, I started out by taking a very low-paying “traineeship” position. Although it wasn’t ideal, it allowed me to learn on-the-job and get my foot in the door.</p><p>A year later, and after a lot of hard work, I got offered a much better position and 3x’ed my previous salary! 🤯</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sf1fhsgwuurkre9a7drq.png" alt="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sf1fhsgwuurkre9a7drq.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Today, I’m currently working as the founding Developer Relations Engineer for <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> where I build things like <a href="http://opensaas.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSaaS.sh</a>,  a free, open-source SaaS starter template for React and NodeJS, along with Stripe, OpenAI, and AWS S3 integration. It’s based on what I learned from building my first profitable SaaS app, <a href="http://coverlettergpt.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoverLetterGPT.xyz</a>, which currently has over 100 customers and makes ~$500 per month! Nothing crazy, but something I’m still proud of. </p><p>And now that I’m currently in a developer-facing role, I often get asked by people in our community for tips on landing jobs in tech. With this in mind, and with these past experiences under my belt, I thought I’d write a comprehensive article that shares what I’ve learned and seen to be the most effective ways to do so. </p><p>Enjoy!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="current-job-market-for-developers-in-2024">Current Job Market for Developers in 2024<a href="#current-job-market-for-developers-in-2024" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Current Job Market for Developers in 2024" title="Direct link to Current Job Market for Developers in 2024">​</a></h2><p>First of all, let’s take a quick look at the current job market for software developers. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7lmohbs24ds94kwxo9dt.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you spend time on Reddit or <a href="http://X.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X.com</a> (aka Twitter), then you’ve probably seen people complaining about how crappy the current job market is for developers. </p><p>To try and find some actual statistics to back up these claims, I used <a href="http://Perplexity.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perplexity.ai</a> to help me find some information on the current demand for software developers, and I was surprised at the results.</p><p>Apparently, the demand for software developers remains high, in fact <strong>the demand is higher than other jobs, on average, and is <a href="https://icts.io/2024/02/01/5-predictions-on-software-development-jobs-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected to grow even more in the coming years</a></strong>! </p><p>So why does it feel even harder than usual for some developers to land a job at the moment? </p><p>Well, that’s because it actually <em>is</em> harder, but only if you’re a less-experienced developer.</p><p>On the other hand, If you’re an experienced dev with a strong portfolio of work, there are a lot more open roles out there for you. But if you’re a junior developer just starting out, the competition is fiercer than ever.</p><p>And there are few reasons for that:</p><ol><li><strong>Complexity of Skills Required</strong>: software development is increasingly complex and requires a broad set of skills, making it <a href="https://nxtide.com/the-global-shortage-of-software-developers-and-its-serious-implication-in-the-comming-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difficult for many candidates to meet job requirements</a>.</li><li><strong>Remote Work Trends</strong>: The shift to remote work has disrupted the entry-level developer pipeline, <a href="https://www.revelo.com/blog/software-developer-shortage-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making it harder for companies to find and train new talent.</a></li><li><strong>Economic Factors</strong>: The pandemic and subsequent economic shifts have led to fluctuating <a href="https://icts.io/2024/02/01/5-predictions-on-software-development-jobs-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hiring patterns, with some periods of high layoffs followed by surges in demand</a>.</li></ol><p>Basically, even though there is high demand for experienced developers, there is a comparatively low demand for the less experienced ones. </p><p>So with this relatively large supply of beginner and mid-level engineers all competing to get the same jobs, how can you gain the skills of an experienced dev and make yourself stand out from the crowd?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-a-problem-solver-not-just-a-coder">Be a problem solver, not just a coder<a href="#be-a-problem-solver-not-just-a-coder" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be a problem solver, not just a coder" title="Direct link to Be a problem solver, not just a coder">​</a></h2><p>A career in software development means that change is a constant. You always have to be ready to learn new things and go outside of your comfort zone because, </p><ol><li>the job demands it, and</li><li>the industry evolves at an extremely fast pace</li></ol><p>In such an environment certificates, courses, and degrees (to a certain extent) matter less, because they don’t prove you have the skill needed to adapt to and solve new problems as they arise. Sure, they prove that you have a certain amount of fundamental knowledge, but that’s only a fraction of the necessary skills needed for the job.</p><p>You want to be able to show that you can tackle a challenge that you’ve never faced before, by:</p><ul><li>quickly learning about this new topic,</li><li>finding a suitable approach to solving it, and</li><li>executing on that approach quickly in order to realize your goal</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@techfren/video/7361777687158983943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2lbjy6ikx8iy9lb3ngx5.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>But don’t just take it from me. AJ, aka <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@techfren/video/7361777687158983943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techfren on TikTok</a>, talks about how to navigate the current job environment in a post-AI world. He makes a couple good points that are related to this article here. For example:</p><ol><li>General coding knowledge is even less relevant because AI possesses a really broad range of coding knowledge. As an engineer, you’re no longer valuable because you know how to code — an AI now knows how to code pretty damn well (and in a lot more programming languages than you). <strong>Your value comes in thinking critically, solving problems, and architecting solutions to those problems.</strong> </li><li>Businesses will start looking more for these generalist problem solvers to build in-house apps (i.e. internal tools) as replacements to paid services in order to save money and meet their specific business demands, since AI allows developers to be way more productive. </li></ol><p>So it’s obvious that problem-solving skills are in high demand, and will continue to be even more important in the future. And we can assume that more experienced, in-demand developers possess those skills, so how do we build them ourselves?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solve-your-own-problems">Solve your own Problems<a href="#solve-your-own-problems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solve your own Problems" title="Direct link to Solve your own Problems">​</a></h2><p>Ok. So you consider yourself to be a curious developer, that can adapt and learn new things quickly, and solve problems on the fly. </p><p>But how do you prove this to prospective employers?</p><p>Easy. Just solve your own problems! In practice — and in the realm of web development — this means “being on the edge of your comfort zone” and building a web app that’s unique to you and your interests. </p><p><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cameronblackwoodcode/video/7364455582981524768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n06z1ktgs70g5c7cv2r7.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Cameron Blackwood, a self-taught engineer and content creator, describes this perfectly in his <a href="https://tiktok.com/@cameronblackwoodcode/video/7364455582981524768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video advising new developers on how to improve their skills</a>. He also has a unique perspective because he previously worked as a tech recruiter, and he says:</p><ul><li>Build a web app that solves a problem you have in your everyday life</li><li>Try different things than you’re currently learning / doing at your day job.</li><li>Keep building and trying new things in your free time.</li></ul><p>Of course, these apps you make don’t have to be perfect, but the more unique they are, and the more they show a creative and well-realized solution to a problem, the better.</p><p>And if you’re having trouble thinking of things to build, sometimes just experimenting with new tools can inspire new ideas. But however you decide to approach it is up to you, the important thing is to start, so get cracking!</p><hr><p>By the way, <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> is a great way to easily build new apps that solve your unique problems. It’s also one of the quickest ways to build bespoke full-stack apps in React &amp; NodeJS without having to write a bunch of boilerplate code for things like auth, routes, end-to-end typesafety, deployments and more. </p><p>As an example, check out this video below which shows you how easy it is to implement full-stack authentication across your entire app.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qiro77q-ulI?si=Crg8qXDOqQaQZK-C" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="do-the-grunt-work">Do the grunt work<a href="#do-the-grunt-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Do the grunt work" title="Direct link to Do the grunt work">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExa2s1d3J6dmQ2ZHc3b2RsYXQxdnFhOWR5Z3licmhjajdxZ2N3anBsOCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/AYECTMLNS4o67dCoeY/giphy.gif" alt="ok" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As I was writing this article, I was lucky enough to come across <a href="https://x.com/jonathanrstern/status/1792220536837230723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tweet from Jonathan Stern</a> where he talks about advice he found extremely valuable when he started his first dev job.</p><p>Before that job, Jonathan wrote an email to Replit's CEO, <a href="https://x.com/amasad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amjad Masad</a> and asked for advice when starting his first job as a software developer. </p><p>Here's what Amjad said:</p><blockquote><p>Two ways to prove yourself and make yourself indispensable:</p><ol><li><p>be incredibly productive and inventive -- which is really hard to do when you're starting out</p></li><li><p>do the boring work that no one wants to do</p></li></ol><p><strong>#2 is available for everyone, it just requires effort and discipline but no one does it, so I would suggest doing that. Incidentally, #2 can often lead to #1 in interesting ways.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Now, even though this is advice for developers who already have a job, I think it is advice that a lot of less experienced devs also looking for jobs should hear.</p><p>Amjad’s advice in a broader sense is to basically lower your expectations at first and work hard. Doing the boring work that no one wants to do also might mean doing work that you’re not keen on, but it will benefit you in the long run.</p><p>This could also mean taking on jobs that aren’t exactly what you wished for earlier on, and doing the grunt work, in order to become that “indispensable” developer that any employer would love to have on their team.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-a-good-person">Be a Good Person<a href="#be-a-good-person" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be a Good Person" title="Direct link to Be a Good Person">​</a></h2><p>This advice is very general, and can apply to just about any job (or anything), but being a good person to work with is probably a lot more valuable and overlooked than most job seekers imagine.</p><p>Once you’ve met the job requirements, a lot of what makes you attractive to prospective employers is whether they could imagine working in a team with you or not. And while that may seem simple and straightforward from the outside, it’s actually a lot harder to put into practice. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3s990jfmwryfx8gk9xw5.gif" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Think about it. </p><p>You’ll be working on a team with lots of different personalities. Tasks can get complex, deadlines get tight, and the work can get messy. Mistakes will be definitely be made. </p><p><em>Are you the type of person to lose their sense of humor under pressure?</em></p><p><em>How will you react when someone blames you for a mistake you weren’t directly responsible for?</em></p><p><em>Do you communicate openly and effectively with your team?</em></p><p><em>Will you stay humble and conscientious after 1 year of hard work with no raise? Will you stay humble and conscientious after 1 year of hard work, lots of praise, and a sweet raise (this is probably even harder)?</em></p><p>Being a honest, open, and genuine are valuable traits that are hard to come by, and people can often tell in an instant if you’re that type of person or not. And it’s these type of people, when put up against other candidates that also meet the job requirements, that ultimately end up getting the job offer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-effort-into-less-applications">More Effort into Less Applications<a href="#more-effort-into-less-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More Effort into Less Applications" title="Direct link to More Effort into Less Applications">​</a></h2><p>One of the things that I and a lot of other employers complain about is when job applicants put little to no effort into their applications. The worst offense is when the application is obviously just a copy-and-paste effort.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNW0wMm03N3IwaTdlcWdtcHd4MXpsZWV5ZDVkMXBzOGQ5ZWVlNG9vaCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/13GIgrGdslD9oQ/giphy.webp" alt="typing" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Employers hate this because it’s an obvious sign of how you will work on the job. If your job application is done lazily, then it’s very likely your work on the job will be performed similarly (or worse!).</p><p>That’s why I think it’s best to put more of your effort into fewer job applications. </p><p>There is no magic number, but whenever I was applying to jobs there were always 2 or 3 that I was <em>really</em> excited about. So those were the only ones I applied to, and I put a lot of thought and effort into these applications.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0kvjr8y8gcc4switxoga.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Besides making <a href="https://vincanger.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own portfolio with descriptions and learning objectives for my projects</a>, I would also create some form of extra content that was related to the job application. In some instances, this was a simple example app, or in others an explainer video or article. </p><p>What was important was that these extra pieces of content were attempts at solving the problems or tasks presented in the job description, to show that I can do that type of work well, and that I’m eager and willing to <em>do the grunt work.</em> </p><p>My assumption was that most other applicants wouldn’t go to these lengths when applying and therefore my application would stand out from the crowd, and it worked well as I got asked to interview for many of those positions even without a lot of prior experience!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="now-get-that-job">Now Get That Job…<a href="#now-get-that-job" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Now Get That Job…" title="Direct link to Now Get That Job…">​</a></h2><p>The software developer job market is changing. It makes sense because the role of the software developer is also constantly evolving, and now that we’re entering the era of AI, these roles are evolving at an even faster pace.</p><p>This means, as employers adapt, they’ll probably continue to look for the developers that can prove they’re able to keep up with all these developments, and utilize the tools at hand to solve problems faced in the world around us.</p><p>So if you’re able to prove this, while being a conscientious and humble worker, than you probably won’t have such a hard time finding that sweet tech job you’ve always wanted. It’s just a matter of putting in the focus and energy on the right things now, which at times may be hard, that will make the process of finding a job later a whole lot easier.</p><p>Thanks for reading and happy job hunting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a complicated one, so you whip out a pen and paper, or head over to <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tldraw</a>, and start drawing a diagram of what your app currently looks like, from database, to server, and on over to the client.</p><p>But how cool would it be if you had a <strong>tool that visualized your entire full-stack app for you</strong>? And what if that tool had the potential to do greater things, like instantly add useful functionality for you across your entire stack, or be paired with AI and Large Language Models for code generation?</p><p>Well, that idea is already a reality, and it’s called <code>wasp studio</code>.

Let me explain.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="You got potential, kid." src="/img/wasp-studio/potential.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Of course, you can use it in its current form to get a better perspective of your app, or maybe plan some new features, but in the future you will be able to use it to do a lot more, such as:</p><ul><li>add new auth methods with a few clicks</li><li>quickly scaffold functional client-side components with server operations</li><li>instantly add new full-stack functionality to your entire app, like Stripe payments</li><li>collaborate easily with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate features on-the-fly!</li></ul><p>Again, this is all possible because of the central configuration file which acts as a set of “instructions” for your app. With this file Wasp literally knows how your app is built, so it can easily display your app to you in visual form. It also makes it a lot easier to build new parts of your app for you in exciting new ways.</p><p>Take a look at another snippet from a Wasp config file below. This is all it takes to get full-stack auth for your web app! That’s because the Wasp compiler is managing that boilerplate code for you.</p><div class="language-c codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

Wasp works, let’s dive deeper into the potential of Wasp and <code>wasp studio</code> in combination with LLMs as a future use case. </p><p>Currently one of the biggest constraints to AI-assisted code generation is context. By now, we all know that LLMs like to hallucinate, <a href="https://glazkov.com/2023/05/18/ai-developer-experience-asymptotes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but they also have a pretty bad “memory”</a>. So, if you were to try and get them to build features for your app, to make sure that the new feature works with it, you have to constantly “remind” them of how the app works, its structure, and dependencies.</p><p>But with Wasp’s config file, which is essentially just a higher-level abstraction of a full-stack app and its features, we give the LLM the context it needs to successfully build new features for the app at hand.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="PG tweet" src="/img/wasp-studio/pg-tweet.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>And this works really well because we don’t only give the LLM the context it needs, but Wasp’s compiler also takes on the responsibility of writing most of the boilerplate for us to begin with (thanks, pal), giving the LLM the simpler tasks of writing, e.g.:</p><ul><li>modifications to the Wasp config file</li><li>functions to be run on the server</li><li>React components that use Wasp code</li></ul><p>In this sense, the LLM has to hold a lot less in context and can be forgiven for its bad memory, because Wasp is the one making sure everything stays nicely glued together! </p><p>To further bring the point home,  let’s take a look again at that Auth code that we introduced above:</p><div class="language-c codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-c codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">auth</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  userEntity</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> User</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  methods</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    usernameAndPassword</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    google</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Consider that this code gives auth across your entire stack. So, not only do you get all the auth logic generated and managed for you on the server, but <a href="/docs/auth/ui">you even get UI components and auth hooks</a> made available to you on the client! </p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Wasp Auth UI" src="/img/wasp-studio/wasp-auth-ui.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>On the other hand, without the abstractions that Wasp gives us, we end up relying on the LLM, with it’s bad memory and tendency to hallucinate, to write a bunch of boilerplate for us over and over again like this JWT middleware pictured below:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Auth without Wasp" src="/img/wasp-studio/auth-node.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>And LLMs are pretty good at coding boilerplatey, repetitive tasks in isolation. But expecting them to do it as part of a cohesive full-stack app means that we have a ton more surface area for exposure to possible errors. </p><p>With Wasp, on the other hand, <strong>it’s just a few lines of code</strong>. If it’s easy for humans to write, it’s also super easy for an LLM to write. </p><p>By the way, not only does this save us a lot of headache, it also can save us a lot of money too, as <a href="/blog/2023/07/17/how-we-built-gpt-web-app-generator">AI-generated Wasp apps use ~10-40x less tokens (i.e. input and output text) than comparable tools</a>, so they generate code at a fraction of the price.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="helping-the-computers-help-us">Helping the Computers Help Us<a href="#helping-the-computers-help-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Helping the Computers Help Us" title="Direct link to Helping the Computers Help Us">​</a></h2><p>As technologies continue to improve, programming will become more accessible to users with less expert knowledge because more of that expert knowledge will be embedded in our tools.</p><p>But that means we will need abstractions that allow for us, the humans, to work easily with these tools. </p><p>Like the LLM example above, we can build tools that get AIs to write all the boilerplate for us over and over again, but the question is, <em>should</em> we be letting them do that when they <em>could</em> be doing other more useful things? LLMs are great at producing a wealth of new ideas quickly. Why not build tools that let AIs help us in this regard?</p><p>That’s exactly what we have planned for the future of <code>wasp studio</code>. A visual interface that allows you to piece together new features of your app, with or without the help of LLMs, and then A/B test those different ideas quickly.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERwtJtNQL28?si=1QtV3DnfQCHjRQrK" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></div><p>Not only that, but we also then have an abstraction at our disposal that allows for easy collaboration with users who are less technically inclined. With the help of such tools, even your Product Manager could get in on the fun and start building new features for the developers to sign off on.</p><p>What’s so powerful about Wasp and its feature set, is that we get code that’s <strong>simpler to read, debug, and maintain,</strong> for both people and machines. Coupled with a visual interface, we will be able to quickly iterate on new features across the entire stack, using it as a planning and orchestration tool ourselves, or as a way to more easily debug and oversee the work an LLM might be doing for us.</p><p>This is a pretty exciting look at the future of web development and with these new tools will come lots of new ways to utilize them. </p><p>What are some ways that you think a tool like <code>wasp studio</code> could be used? What other developments in the realm of AI x Human collaboration can you imagine are coming soon?</p>]]></content:encoded>

On top of that, many of these boilerplates rely heavily on 3rd-party services. Add on hosting and other fees, and you’re looking at spending quite a bit of money just to get your idea out there into the world.</p><p>That’s why with Open SaaS we made a conscious decision to try and use open-source and free services whenever possible. For example, our hosted demo app and its admin dashboard on <a href="http://OpenSaaS.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSaaS.sh</a> are powered by a self-hosted version of Plausible analytics. Want the same features in your SaaS? Well, Open SaaS has got it preconfigured for you!</p><p>Also, the <a href="https://wasp.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp framework</a>, which Open SaaS uses, does the job of building out a number of features for you, like Auth and Cron Jobs, so that you don’t have to pay a 3rd-party service or code it entirely yourself (we’ll explain this in more detail later).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-we-start">Before we start...<a href="#before-we-start" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before we start..." title="Direct link to Before we start...">​</a></h2><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/open-saas?utm_source=badge-featured&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-open-saas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=436467&amp;theme=light" alt="Open SaaS - Open-source &amp; 100% free React &amp; Node.js SaaS starter! | Product Hunt" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Open SaaS is <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/open-saas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live on Product Hunt</a> right now! Come support our free, open-source initiative 🙏</p><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/open-saas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wppn8mlby0p7h1f8xl6w.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-we-built-it-and-then-gave-it-away-for-free">Why we built it… and then gave it away for free<a href="#why-we-built-it-and-then-gave-it-away-for-free" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why we built it… and then gave it away for free" title="Direct link to Why we built it… and then gave it away for free">​</a></h2><p>The initial feedback in <a href="https://devhunt.org/tool/open-saas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our pre-release</a> has been largely positive, but we’ve also gotten some questions like:</p><ul><li>“Is it going to stay free?”</li><li>“What’s your motivation for open-sourcing this?”</li></ul><p>So we thought we’d go ahead and answer these to start.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rac9o1rxgrwfx51mc50.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>First, yes it is 100% free and open-source and will stay that way.</p><p>Second, we believe that the collective knowledge of a community of developers, indiehackers, and solopreneurs will produce a better boilerplate than an individual or small group. When you buy a SaaS starter from some developer, you’re already getting an opinionated stack, then on top of that you’re also getting an app built the way they think is best — and that may not always be the best <em>for you.</em> </p><p>Third, <a href="https://opensaas.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open SaaS</a> is a project by <a href="https://wasp.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>, an open-source React + NodeJS + Prisma full-stack framework with superpowers. We, the Wasp team, believe that Wasp is very well suited for creating SaaS apps quickly and efficiently, and we want this template to prove it. Plus, as developers, we’ve learned so much from other open-source projects, and Wasp itself is an open-source project. </p><p>Basically, we love the open-source philosophy and we want to pay it forward. 🙏</p><p>So it’s our hope that we can provide a seriously valuable asset to the developer community while spreading the word about our open-source, full-stack framework. And we’d love to see the community contribute to it so that it will grow and become the best SaaS boilerplate out there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-open-saas-is-made-of">What Open SaaS is Made Of<a href="#what-open-saas-is-made-of" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Open SaaS is Made Of" title="Direct link to What Open SaaS is Made Of">​</a></h2><p>We put a lot of hard work into Open SaaS, including the <a href="https://docs.opensaas.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>, so that developers can get a SaaS app launched confidently and easily.</p><p>We’ve also spent some time checking out other free, open-source SaaS starters, and wanted to make sure Open SaaS has all the right features of a production-ready starter, without the bloat. And we think we’ve accomplished that for the most part, although we will continue to add features and improve on it with time. </p><p>Here are the main features at the moment:</p><ul><li>🔐 Authentication (email verified, google, github)</li><li>📩 Emailing (sendgrid, emailgun, SMTP)</li><li>📈 Admin Dashboard (plausible or google analytics)</li><li>🤑 Stripe payments (just add your subscription product IDs)</li><li>⌨️ End-to-end Typesafety (no configuration necessary)</li><li>🤖 OpenAI integrated (AI-powered example apps)</li><li>📖 Blog w/ Astro</li><li>🚀 Deploy anywhere</li><li>📄 Full Documentation &amp; Community Support</li></ul><p>It’s worth going into some detail about each of these features, so let’s do it.</p><h3 class="anchor

alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Thanks to Wasp, Open SaaS ships with a number of possible Auth methods:</p><ul><li>username and password (simplest/easiest for dev testing)</li><li>email verified w/ password reset</li><li>Google and/or Github social login</li></ul><p>Here’s where Wasp really shines, because all it takes to set up your full-stack Auth and get

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Launch Week 5 is here" src="/img/lw5/lw5-banner.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>New Year, New Wasp! That's we at first wanted to use as motto for this launch, but then I bought a DALL-E subscription and typed in "<em>Waspnado, but with plushies</em>". The rest is history.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Wasp is getting dangerously close to 10,000 stars on GitHub and our Discord community is shy of 2,000 members! We're seeing more and more users building and deploying cool apps, both AI-powered, but also good old SaaS-es. Another thing we still have to get used to is getting nice messages from you, such as this one: </p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Nice testimonial" src="/img/lw5/nice-testimonial.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Thank you! This means a lot to us and reassures our that we are on the right path. Now, without the further ado, let's dive in and see what awaits us this week (a tornado of new features, of course):</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1-wasp-auth-20">Day 1: Wasp Auth 2.0<a href="#day-1-wasp-auth-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1: Wasp Auth 2.0" title="Direct link to Day 1: Wasp Auth 2.0">​</a></h2><p><a href="/docs/auth/overview">Auth</a> is one Wasp's flagship, and most popular features. All you need to do is add providers you want to use in Wasp config file (e.g. email, Google, or GitHub) and poof - <strong>Wasp will magically create a full-stack auth for you, from the database models to the UI components that you can simply import and use</strong>. Here's an 1-minute tour:</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qiro77q-ulI?si=y8Rejsbjb1HJC6FA" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></div><p>And the best part - <strong>this all works without any 3rd party services</strong>! This is all your code that runs on your infrastructure, and you don't have to pay for it, no matter how many users you have. Pretty neat, huh?</p><p>This is all old news, so what's new? I won't spoil too much, but we might have made it even easier to use (no more manually defining data models), plus it now might use a popular library that starts with "<em>L</em>" (and ends with "<em>ucia</em>") under the hood. I won't say anything more!</p><p><strong>Read more about it:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/WaspLang/status/1749830729448481254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter thread introing Wasp Auth 2.0</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2-wasp-restructured---packagejson-is-back-️">Day 2: Wasp, restructured - <code>package.json</code> is back! 🏗️<a href="#day-2-wasp-restructured---packagejson-is-back-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to day-2-wasp-restructured---packagejson-is-back-️" title="Direct link to day-2-wasp-restructured---packagejson-is-back-️">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Pinocchio" src="/img/lw5/real-framework.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Yes, Wasp, you are a real framework now!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>This is a big one, and the most complex feature we'll be shipping this week! We've been designing Wasp from day 1 to work nicely with other pieces of the stack, such as React and Node.js. But, some decisions we made in the process on how all these work together weren't the most elegant, both for you as users and us as developers of the framework. </p><p>With these changes, <strong>Wasp will feel much more like a "real" framework that you are used to</strong> - you will be able to use <code>npm install</code>, access your <code>package.json</code>, <code>tsconfig</code>, and more!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3-wasp-ai-aka-mage-now-lives-in-your-cli--">Day 3: Wasp AI aka MAGE now lives in your CLI! 🤖 📟<a href="#day-3-wasp-ai-aka-mage-now-lives-in-your-cli--" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3: Wasp AI aka MAGE now lives in your CLI! 🤖 📟" title="Direct link to Day 3: Wasp AI aka MAGE now lives in your CLI! 🤖 📟">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://usemage.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAGE</a> is an AI-powered, full-stack, React and Node.js web app generator powered by Wasp.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine you’ve been tasked to implement a sizeable new feature for the product you’re working on. That’s the opportunity you’ve been waiting for - everybody will see what a 10x developer you are! You open a list of the coolest new libraries and design patterns you’ve wanted to try out and get right into it, full “basement” mode. One week later, you victoriously emerge and present your perfect pull request!</p><p><strong>But then, the senior dev in a team immediately rejects it - <em>“Too complex, you should have simply used library X and reused Y.”</em></strong>. What!? Before you know it, you’re looking at 100 comments on your PR and days of refactoring to follow.</p><p>If only there were <strong>a way of knowing about X and Y before implementing everything</strong>. Well, it is, and it’s called RFC!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="The revelation of RFC" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-prophet.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>We’ll learn about it through the example of <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/RFC-Auth-without-user-defined-entities-6d2925439627456ab01b74ff4b4cd087?pvs=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC about implementing an authentication system in a web framework Wasp</a>. <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> is a full-stack web framework built on top of React, Node.js and Prisma. It is used by <a href="https://usemage.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MAGE</a>, a free GPT-powered codebase generator, which has been used to start over 30,000 applications.</p><p>Let's dive in!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-an-rfc">So, what is an RFC?<a href="#so-what-is-an-rfc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So, what is an RFC?" title="Direct link to So, what is an RFC?">​</a></h2><p>RFC (<em>Request For Comments</em>) is, simply explained, a document proposing a codebase change to solve a specific problem. <strong>Its main purpose is to find the best way to solve a problem, as a team effort, before the implementation starts</strong>. RFCs were first adopted by the open-source community, but today, they are used in almost any type of developer organization.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC overivew" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-overview.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">A simplified schema of a typical RFC.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>There are other names for this type of document you might encounter in the industry, like TDD (<em>Technical Design Document</em>) or SDD (<em>Software Design Document</em>). Some people argue over the distinction between them, but we won’t.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: RFCs were invented by IETF (<em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em>), the engineering organization behind some of the most important internet standards and protocols we use today, like TCP/IP! Not too shabby, right?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-should-i-write-rfc-and-when-can-i-skip-it">When should I write RFC, and when can I skip it?<a href="#when-should-i-write-rfc-and-when-can-i-skip-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When should I write RFC, and when can I skip it?" title="Direct link to When should I write RFC, and when can I skip it?">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC overivew" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-meme-when.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>So, why bother writing about what you will eventually code, instead of saving time and simply doing it? <strong>If you’re dealing with a bug or a relatively simple feature, where it’s very clear what you must do and doesn’t affect project structure, then there’s no need for an RFC - fire up that IDE and get cracking!</strong></p><p>But, if you are introducing a completely new concept (e.g., introducing a role-based permission system) or altering the project’s architecture (e.g., adding support for running background jobs), then you might want to take a step back before typing <code>git checkout -b my-new-feature</code> and diving into that sweet coding zone.</p><p>All the above being said, sometimes it's not easy to figure out if you should write an RFC or not. Maybe it’s a more prominent feature, but you’ve done something similar before, and you’ve already mapped everything out in your head and pretty much have no questions. To help with that, here’s a simple heuristic I like to use: <strong>Is there more than one obvious way to implement this feature? Is there a new library/service we have to pick?</strong> If the answer to both of these is “No", you probably don’t need an RFC. Otherwise, there’s a discussion to be had, and RFC is the way to do it.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC decision flowchart" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-flowchart.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="it-sounds-useful-but-whats-in-it-for-me">It sounds useful. But what’s in it for me?<a href="#it-sounds-useful-but-whats-in-it-for-me" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to It sounds useful. But what’s in it for me?" title="Direct link to It sounds useful. But what’s in it for me?">​</a></h2><p>We’ve established how to decide <em>when</em> to write an RFC, but here is also <em>why</em> you should do it:</p><ul><li><strong>You will organize your thoughts and get clarity</strong>. If you’ve decided to write an RFC, that means you’re dealing with a non-trivial, open-ended problem. Writing things down will help distill your thoughts and have an objective look at them.</li><li><strong>You will learn more</strong> than if you just jumped into coding. You will give yourself space to explore different approaches and oftentimes discover something you haven’t even thought of initially.</li><li><strong>You will crowdsource your team’s knowledge.</strong> By asking your team for feedback (hence Request For Comments), you will get a complete picture of the problem you’re solving and fill in any remaining gaps.</li><li><strong>You will advance your team’s understanding of the codebase.</strong> By collaborating on your RFC, everybody on the team will understand what you’re doing and how you eventually did it. That means next time somebody has to touch that part of the code, they will need to ask you much less questions (=== more uninterrupted coding time!).</li><li><strong>PR reviews will go <em>much</em> smoother</strong>. Remember that situation from the beginning of this article, when your PR got rejected as "too complex"? That’s because the reviewer is missing the context, and you made a sizeable change without a previous buy-in from the rest of the team. By writing an RFC first, you’ll never encounter this type of situation again.</li><li><strong>Your documentation is already 50% done!</strong> To be clear, RFC is not the final documentation, and you cannot simply point to it, but you can likely reuse a lot - images, diagrams, paragraphs, etc.</li></ul><p>Wow, this sounds so good that I want to come up with a new feature right now just so I can write an RFC for it! Joke aside, going through with the RFC first makes the coding part so much more enjoyable - you know exactly what you need to do, and you don’t need to question your approach and how it will be received once you create that PR.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ok-ok-im-sold-so-how-do-i-go-about-writing-one">Ok, ok, I’m sold! So, how do I go about writing one?<a href="#ok-ok-im-sold-so-how-do-i-go-about-writing-one" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ok, ok, I’m sold! So, how do I go about writing one?" title="Direct link to Ok, ok, I’m sold! So, how do I go about writing one?">​</a></h2><p>Glad you asked! Many different formats are being used, more or less formal, but I prefer to keep it simple. RFCs that we write at Wasp don’t follow a strict format, but there are some common parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Metadata</strong> - Title, date, reviewers, etc…</li><li><strong>Problem / Goal</strong></li><li><strong>Proposed solution</strong> (or more of them)</li><li><strong>Implementation overview</strong></li><li><strong>Remarks / open questions</strong></li></ul><p>That’s pretty much the gist of it! Each of these can be further broken down and refined, but this is the basic outline you can start with.</p><p>Let’s now go over each of these and see what they look like in practice, on our <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/RFC-Auth-without-user-defined-entities-6d2925439627456ab01b74ff4b4cd087?pvs=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentication in Wasp</a> example.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metadata-">Metadata ⌗<a href="#metadata-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metadata ⌗" title="Direct link to Metadata ⌗">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC metadata" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-metadata.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>This one is pretty self-explanatory - you will want to track some basic info about your RFCs - status, date of creation, etc. </p><p>Some templates also explicitly list the reviewers and the status of their “approval” of the RFC, similar to the PR review process - we don’t have it since we’re a small team where communication happens fast, but it can be handy for larger teams where not everybody knows everybody, and you want to have a bit more of a process in place (e.g. when mentoring junior developers).</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC reviewer status" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-reviewer-status-example.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Some RFCs require explicit approval by each reviewer.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-">The problem 🤔<a href="#the-problem-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem 🤔" title="Direct link to The problem 🤔">​</a></h2><p>This is where things get interesting. <strong>The better you define the problem or the goal/feature you need to implement, and why you need to do it, the easier all the following steps will be</strong>. So this is something worth investing in even before you start writing your RFC - make sure you talk to all the involved parties (e.g., product owner, other developers, and even users) to refine your understanding of the issue you’re about to tackle.</p><p>By doing this, you will also very likely get first hints and pointers on the possible solutions, and develop a rough sense of the problem space you’re in.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="RFC problem definition" src="/img/writing-rfcs/rfc-problem.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Here are a few tips from the example above:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with a high-level summary</strong> - that way, readers can quickly decide if this is relevant to them or not and whether they should keep reading.</li><li><strong>Provide some context</strong> - Explain a bit about the current state of the world, as it is right now. This can be a single sentence or a whole chapter, depending on the intended audience.</li><li><strong>Clearly state the problem/goal</strong> - explain why there is a problem and connect it with the user’s/company’s pain, so that motivation is clear.</li><li><strong>Provide extra details if possible</strong> - diagrams, code examples, … → anything that can help the reader get faster to that “aha” moment. Extra points for using collapsible sections, so the central part of the RFC remains of digestible length.</li></ul><p>If you did all this, you’re already well on your way to the excellent RFC! Since defining the problem well is essential, don’t be afraid to add more to it and break things down further.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="non-goals-">Non-goals 🛑<a href="#non-goals-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Non-goals 🛑" title="Direct link to Non-goals 🛑">​</a></h3><p>This is the sub-section of the "Problem" or "Goal" section that can sometimes be super valuable. Writing what we don't want or will not be doing in this codebase change can help set the expectations and better define its scope.</p><p>For example, if we are working on adding a role-based authentication system to our app, people might assume that we will also build some sort of an admin panel for it to manage users and add/remove roles. By explicitly stating it won't be done (and briefly explaining why - not needed, it would take too long, it will be done in the next iteration, ...), reviewers will get a better understanding of what your goal is and you will skip unnecessary discussion.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solution--implementation-️">Solution &amp; Implementation 🛠️<a href="#solution--implementation-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solution &amp; Implementation 🛠️" title="Direct link to Solution &amp; Implementation 🛠️">​</a></h2><p>Once we know what we want to do, we have to figure out the best way of doing it! You might have already hinted at the possible solution in the Problem section, but now is the moment to dive deeper - research different approaches, evaluate their pros and cons, and sketch how they could fit into the existing system.</p><p>This section is probably the most free-form of all - since it highly depends on the nature of what you are doing, it doesn’t make sense to impose many restrictions here. You may want to stay at the higher level of, e.g., system architecture, or you may need to dive deep into the code and start writing parts of the code you will need. Due to that, I don’t have an exact format for you to follow, but rather a set of guidelines:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="write-pseudocode">Write pseudocode<a href="#write-pseudocode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Write pseudocode" title="Direct link to Write pseudocode">​</a></h3><p>The purpose of RFC is to convey ideas and principles, not production-grade code that compiles and covers all the edge cases. Feel free to invent/imagine/sketch whatever you need (e.g., imagine you already have a function that sends an email and just use it, even if you don’t), and don’t encumber yourself or the reader with the implementation details (unless that’s exactly what the RFC is about).</p><p>It’s better to start at the higher level, and then go deeper when you realize you need it or if one of the reviewers suggests it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="find-out-how-are-others-doing-it">Find out how are others doing it<a href="#find-out-how-are-others-doing-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Find out how are others doing it" title="Direct link to Find out how are others doing it">​</a></h3><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="See what others are doing" src="/img/writing-rfcs/existing-solutions.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>How you find this out may differ depending on the type of product you’re developing, but there is almost always a way to do it. If you’re developing an open-source tool like <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> you can simply check out other popular solutions (that are also open-source) and learn how they did it. If you’re working on a SaaS and need to figure out whether to use cookies or JWTs for the authentication, you likely have some friends who have done it before, and you can ask them. Lastly, simply Google/GPT it.</p><p>Why is this so helpful? <strong>The reason is that it gives you (and the reviewers) confidence in your solution. If somebody else did it successfully this way, it might be a promising direction.</strong> It also might help you discover approaches you haven’t thought of before, or serve as a basis on top of which you can build. Of course, never take anything for granted and take into account the specific needs of your situation, but definitely make use of the knowledge and expertise of others.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="leave-things-unfinished--dont-make-it-perfect">Leave things unfinished &amp; don't make it perfect<a href="#leave-things-unfinished--dont-make-it-perfect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leave things unfinished &amp; don't make it perfect" title="Direct link to Leave things unfinished &amp; don't make it perfect">​</a></h3><p>The main point of RFC is the “C” part, so collaboration (yes, I know it actually stands for "<em>comments</em>"). <strong>RFC is not a test where you have to get the perfect score and have no questions asked - if that happens, you probably shouldn’t have written it in the first place.</strong></p><p>Solving a problem is a team effort, and you’re just the person taking the first stab at it and pushing things forward. Your task is to lay as much groundwork as you reasonably can (refine the problem, explore multiple approaches to solving it, identify new subproblems that came to light) so the reviewers can quickly grasp the status and provide efficient feedback, directed where it’s needed the most.</p><p><strong>The main job of your RFC is to identify the most important problems and direct the reviewer’s attention to them, not solve them.</strong></p><p>The RFC you’re writing should be looked at as a discussion area and a work-in-progress, not a piece of art that has to be perfected before it’s displayed in front of the audience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="remarks--open-questions-">Remarks &amp; open questions 🎯<a href="#remarks--open-questions-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Remarks &amp; open questions 🎯" title="Direct link to Remarks &amp; open questions 🎯">​</a></h2><p>In this final section of the document, you can summarise the main thoughts and highlight the biggest open questions. After going through everything, it can be helpful for the reader to be reminded of where his attention can be most valuable.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="now-i-know-when-and-how-to-write-an-rfc-do-you-have-any-templates-i-could-use-as-a-starting-point">Now I know when and how to write an RFC!

As mentioned, our format is extremely lightweight, but feel free to take a look at <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/RFC-Auth-without-user-defined-entities-6d2925439627456ab01b74ff4b4cd087?pvs=4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the RFC we used as an example</a> to get inspired. Your company could also already have a ready template they recommend.</p><p>Here are a few you can use and/or adapt to your needs:</p><ul><li><a href="https://engineering.squarespace.com/s/Squarespace-RFC-Template.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squarespace RFC template</a></li><li><em>Do you have a template you would recommend?

There are so many choices!" title="Direct link to What tool should I use to write my RFCs? There are so many choices!">​</a></h2><p>The exact tool you’re using is probably the least important part of RFC-ing, but it still matters since it sets the workflow around it. If your company has already selected a tool, then of course stick with that. If not, here are the most common choices I’ve come across, along with quick comments:</p><ul><li><strong>Google Docs</strong> - the classic choice. Super easy to comment on any part of the doc, which is the most important feature.</li><li><strong>Notion</strong> - also great for collaboration, plus offers some markdown components such as collapsibles and tables, which can make your RFC more readable.</li><li><strong>GitHub issues / PRs</strong> - this is sometimes used, especially for OSS projects. The drawback is that it is harder to comment on the specific part of the document (you can only comment on the whole line), plus inserting diagrams is also quite clunky. The pro is that everything (code and RFCs) stays on the same platform</li></ul><p>We currently use Notion, but any of the above can be a good choice.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Just as it is the best practice to write a summary at the end of your RFC, we will do the same here! This article came out longer than I expected, but there were so many things to mention - I hope you'll find it useful!</p><p>Finally, <strong>being able to clearly express your thoughts, formulate the problem, and objectively analyze the possible solutions, with feedback from the team, is what will help you develop the right thing, which is the ultimate productivity hack</strong>. This is how you become a 10x engineer.</p><p>And don't forget: <em>Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

We will go through all necessary steps to set up your dev environment and get you started with Wasp development in Windows in no time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-wsl-and-why-should-i-be-interested-in-it">What is WSL and why should I be interested in it?<a href="#what-is-wsl-and-why-should-i-be-interested-in-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is WSL and why should I be interested in it?" title="Direct link to What is WSL and why should I be interested in it?">​</a></h2><p>Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL) lets developers run a fully functional and native GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows. In other words, we can run Linux directly without using a virtual machine or dual-booting the system.</p><p><strong>The first cool thing about it is that WSL allows you to never switch OS’s, but still have the best of both worlds inside your OS.</strong>
What does that mean for us regular users? When you look at the way WSL works in practice, it can be considered a Windows feature that runs a Linux OS directly inside Windows 10 or 11, with a fully functional Linux file system, Linux command line tools, and Linux GUI apps (<em>really cool, btw</em>). Besides that, it uses much fewer resources for running when compared to a virtual machine and also doesn’t require a separate tool for creating and managing those virtual machines.</p><p>WSL is mainly catered to developers, so this article will be focused on developer usage and how to set up a fully working dev environment with VS Code. Inside this article, we’ll go through some of the cool features and how they can be used in practice. Plus, the best way to understand new things is to actually start using them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="installing-wsl-on-the-windows-operating-system">Installing WSL on the Windows operating system<a href="#installing-wsl-on-the-windows-operating-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Installing WSL on the Windows operating system" title="Direct link to Installing WSL on the Windows operating system">​</a></h2><p>In order to install WSL on your Windows, first enable <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper-V</a> architecture is Microsoft’s hardware virtualization solution.

There, you will enter some basic info. First, you will enter your username and after that your password. Both of those will be Linux-specific, so you don’t necessarily have to repeat your Windows credentials. After we’ve done this, the installation part is over! You have successfully installed Ubuntu on your Windows machine! It still feels weird to say this, right?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cool-wsl-featues-to-help-you-along-the-way">Cool WSL featues to help you along the way<a href="#cool-wsl-featues-to-help-you-along-the-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cool WSL featues to help you along the way" title="Direct link to Cool WSL featues to help you along the way">​</a></h3><p>But before we get down to our dev environment setup, I want to show you a couple of cool tricks that will make your life easier and help you understand why WSL is actually a game-changer for Windows users.</p><p>The first cool thing with WSL is that you don’t have to give up the current way of managing files through Windows Explorer. In your sidebar in Windows Explorer, you can find the Linux option now right under the network tab.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/647jdnzilrucsijtye3v.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>From there, you can access and manage your Linux OS’s file system directly from the Windows Explorer. What is really cool with this feature is that you can basically copy, paste, and move files between different operating systems without any issues, which opens up a whole world of possibilities. Effectively, you don’t have to change much in your workflow with files and you can move many projects and files from one OS to another effortlessly. If you download an image for your web app on your Windows browser, just copy and paste it to your Linux OS.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/iqjsd1oz5a4alu6q08re.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Another very important thing, which we will use in our example is WSL2 virtual routes. As you now have OS inside your OS, they have a way of communicating. When you want to access your Linux OS’s network (for example, when you want to access your web app running locally in Linux), you can use <em>${PC-name}.local</em>. For me, since my PC name is Boris-PC, my network address is boris-pc.local. That way you don’t have to remember different IP addresses, which is really cool. If you want your address for whatever reason, you can go to your Linux distro’s terminal, and type ipconfig. Then, you can see your Windows IP and Linux’s IP address. With that, you can communicate with both operating systems without friction.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lkhcfiybnobuoziitwtm.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The final cool thing I want to highlight is Linux GUI apps. It is a very cool feature that helps make WSL a more attractive proposal for regular users as well. You can install any app you want on your Linux system using popular package managers, such as apt (default on Ubuntu) or flatpak. Then you can launch them as well from the command line and the app will start and be visible inside your Windows OS. But that can cause some friction and is not user-friendly. The really ground-breaking part of this feature is that you can launch them directly from your Windows OS without even starting WSL yourself. Therefore, you can create shortcuts and pin them to the Start menu or taskbar without any friction and really have no need to think about where your app comes from. For the showcase, I have installed Dolphin File Manager and run it through Windows OS. You can see it action below side by side with Windows Explorer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yq1nxj244jd1fci13oay.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started-with-development-on-wsl">Getting started with development on WSL<a href="#getting-started-with-development-on-wsl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting started with development on WSL" title="Direct link to Getting started with development on WSL">​</a></h2><p>After hearing all about the cool features of WSL, let’s slowly get back on track with our tutorial. Next up is setting up our dev environment and starting our first app. I’ll be setting up a web dev environment and we’ll use <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> as an example.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with it, Wasp is a Rails-like framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma. It’s a fast and easy way to develop and deploy your full-stack web apps. For our tutorial, Wasp is a perfect candidate, since it doesn’t support Windows development natively, but only through WSL as it requires a Unix environment.</p><p>Let’s get started with installing Node.js first. NVM is the best tool for versioning Node.js, so we want to start with both Node.js and NVM installation.</p><p>But first things first, let’s start with Node.js. In WSL, run:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">sudo</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">apt</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">install</span><span class="token plain"> nodejs</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>in order to install Node on your Linux environment.

We've come a long way since our first launch week, Beta release, which moved Wasp from a prototype to a real, working framework. In the previous two launch weeks we've added plenty of new features and unlocked functionalities you couldn't have used before (e.g. email sending, async jobs, ...).</p><p>This time we kept introducing new features, but we also realised there are many opportunities to make developers' lives even easier. That's why the theme of this launch week stems from "Evolution" - Wasp is now well set on its way, lies on the solid foundations with a strong community behind it and keeps naturally evolving!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Growing up" src="/img/lw4/grown_up.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Wasp from this launch onwards.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Enough chit-chat - let's see what will go down next week!

uninformative</strong>.</li><li><code>a</code> is reused in lambda inside the <code>map</code>, <strong>shadowing</strong> the <code>a</code> that is a function argument, confusing the reader and making it easier to make a mistake when modifying the code in the future and reference the wrong variable.</li><li>The returned object doesn’t have any info about what it contains, instead, <strong>you need to be careful about the order of its elements</strong> when using it later.</li><li>The name of the field <code>.info</code> in the result of a call to <code>users()</code> function gives us <strong>no information as to what it contains</strong>, which is made further worse by its elements being accessed by their position, also hiding any information about them and making our

do?</p><ol><li><strong>The name of the function now exactly reflects what it does, no more no less</strong>. <code>fetch</code> in the name even indicates it does some IO (input/output, in this case fetching from the database), which can be good to know since IO is relatively slow/expensive compared to pure code.</li><li><strong>We made other names informative enough</strong>: not too much, not too little.<ul><li>Notice how <strong>we used the name <code>users</code> for fetched users</strong>, and not something longer like <code>usersWithSpecifiedFirstAndLastName</code> or <code>fetchedUsers</code>: there is no need for a longer name, as this variable is very local, short-lived, and there is enough context around it to make it clear what it is about.</li><li><strong>Inside lambda, we went with a single-letter name</strong>, <code>u</code>, which might seem like bad practice. But, here, it is perfect: this variable is extremely short-lived, and it is clear from context what it stands for. Also, we picked specifically the letter <code>u</code> for a reason, as it is the first letter of <code>user</code>, therefore making that connection obvious.</li></ul></li><li><strong>We named values in the object that we return</strong>: <code>averageAge</code> and <code>medianSalary</code>. Now any code that will use our function won’t need to rely on the ordering of items in the result, and also will be easy and informative to read.</li></ol><p>Finally, notice how there is no comment above the function anymore.

What does that mean, how do we recognize them?</p><p><strong>Good name doesn’t misdirect, doesn’t omit, and doesn’t assume</strong>.</p><p>A good name should give you a good idea about what the variable contains or function does. A good name will tell you all there is to know or will tell you enough to know where to look next. It will not let you guess, or wonder. It will not misguide you. A good name is obvious, and expected. It is consistent. Not overly creative. It will not assume context or knowledge that the reader is not likely to have.</p><p>Also, <strong>context is king:</strong> you can’t evaluate the name without the context in which it is read. <code>verifyOrganizationChainCredentials</code> could be a terrible name or a great name. <code>a</code> could be a great name or a terrible name. It depends on the story, the surroundings, on the problem the code is solving. Names tell a story, and they need to fit together like a story.</p><h1>Examples of famous bad names</h1><ul><li><strong>JavaScript</strong><ul><li>I was the victim of this bad naming myself: my parents bought me a book about JavaScript while I wanted to learn Java.</li></ul></li><li><strong>HTTP Authorization header</strong><ul><li>It is named <code>Authorization</code>, but is used for authentication! And those are not the same: authentication is about identifying yourself, and authorization is about granting permissions. More about it can be found here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062024/why-is-the-http-header-for-authentication-called-authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062024/why-is-the-http-header-for-authentication-called-authorization</a> .</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wasp-lang</strong>:<ul><li>This one is my fault: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> is a full-stack JS web framework that uses a custom config language as only a small part of its codebase, but I put <code>-lang</code> in the name and scared a lot of people away because they thought it was a whole new general programming language!</li></ul></li></ul><h1>How to come up with a good name</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-give-a-name-find-it">Don’t give a name, find it<a href="#dont-give-a-name-find-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don’t give a name, find it" title="Direct link to Don’t give a name, find it">​</a></h2><p>The best advice is maybe not to give a name, but instead to <strong>find out</strong> a name. You shouldn’t be making up an original name, as if you are naming a pet or a child; <strong>you are instead looking for the essence of the thing you are naming, and the name should present itself based on it</strong>. If you don’t like the name you discovered, it means you don’t like the thing you are naming, and you should change that thing by improving the design of your code (as we did in the example #2).</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="You shouldn't name your variables the same way you name your pets, and vice versa" src="/img/on-importance-of-naming-in-programming/variables-naming-pet-white.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="things-to-look-out-for-when-figuring-out-a-name">Things to look out for when figuring out a name<a href="#things-to-look-out-for-when-figuring-out-a-name" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Things to look out for when figuring out a name" title="Direct link to Things to look out for when figuring out a name">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>First, make sure it is not a bad name :)</strong>. Remember: don’t misdirect, don’t omit, don’t assume.</li><li><strong>Make it reflect what it represents.</strong> Find the essence of it, capture it in the name. Name is still ugly? Improve the code. You have also other things to help you here → type signature, and comments. But those come secondary.</li><li><strong>Make it play nicely with the other names around it.</strong> It should have a clear relation to them - be in the same “world”. It should be similar to similar stuff, opposite to opposite stuff. It should make a story together with other names around it. It should take into account the context it is in.</li><li><strong>Length follows the scope</strong>. In general, the shorter-lived the name is, and the smaller its scope is, the shorter the name can/should be, and vice versa. This is why it can be ok to use one-letter variables in short lambda functions. If not sure, go for the longer name.</li><li><strong>Stick to the terminology you use in the codebase</strong>. If you so far used the term <code>server</code>, don’t for no reason start using the term <code>backend</code> instead. Also, if you use <code>server</code> as a term, you likely shouldn't go with <code>frontend</code>: instead, you will likely want to use <code>client</code>, which is a term more closely related to the <code>server</code>.</li><li><strong>Stick to the conventions you use in the codebase</strong>. Examples of some of the conventions that I often use in my codebases:<ul><li>prefix <code>is</code> when the variable is Bool (e.g. <code>isAuthEnabled</code>)</li><li>prefix <code>ensure</code> for the functions that are idempotent, that will do something (e.g allocate a resource) only if it hasn’t been set up so far (e.g. <code>ensureServerIsRunning</code>).</li></ul></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-simple-technique-for-figuring-out-a-name-every-time">The simple technique for figuring out a name every time<a href="#the-simple-technique-for-figuring-out-a-name-every-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The simple technique for figuring out a name every time" title="Direct link to The simple technique for figuring out a name every time">​</a></h2><p>If you are ever having trouble coming up with a name, do the following:</p><ol><li>Write a comment above the function/variable where you <strong>describe what it is, in human language</strong>, as if you were describing it to your colleague. It might be one sentence or multiple sentences.
This is the essence of what your function/variable does, what it is.</li><li>Now, you take the role of the sculptor, and you chisel at and <strong>shape that description of your function/variable until you get a name</strong>, by taking pieces of it away. You stop when you feel that one more hit of your imagined chisel at it would take too much away.</li><li>Is your name still too complex/confusing? If that is so, that means that the code behind is too complex, and should be reorganized! <strong>Go refactor it</strong>.</li><li><strong>Ok, all done</strong> → you have a nice name!</li><li>That comment above the function/variable? Remove everything from it that is now captured in the code (name + arguments + type signature). If you can remove the whole comment, great. Sometimes you can’t, because some stuff can’t be captured in the code (e.g. certain assumptions, explanations, examples, …), and that is also okay. But don’t repeat in the comment what you can say in the code instead. <strong>Comments are a necessary evil and are here to capture knowledge that you can’t capture in your names and/or types</strong>.</li></ol><p>Don’t get overly stuck on always figuring out the perfect name at the get-go → it is okay to do multiple iterations of your code, with both your code and name improving with each iteration.</p><h1>Reviewing code with naming in mind</h1><p>Once you start thinking a lot about naming, you will see how it will change your code review process: focus shifts from looking at implementation details to looking at names first.</p><p><strong>When I am doing a code review, there is one predominant thought I will be thinking about: “Is this name clear?”</strong>. From there, the whole review evolves and results in clean code.</p><p>Inspecting a name is a single point of pressure, that untangles the whole mess behind it. Search for bad names, and you will sooner or later uncover the bad code if there is some.</p><h1>Further reading</h1><p>If you haven’t yet read it, I would recommend reading the book <strong>Clean Code by Robert Martin</strong>. It has a great chapter on naming and also goes much further on how to write code that you and others will enjoy reading and maintaining.</p><p>Also, <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A popular joke about naming being hard</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In this article, we’re going to see how open-source can change your career for the better and get you out of the Skill Paradox — a point in which the skills you need to land a job are generally acquired after you get a job.</p><p>Besides that, we’ll check how you can start contributing to different open-source projects and get on the hype train of <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacktoberfest</a> while also learning some important topics on handling feedbacks and showcasing your contributions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-introduction">1. Introduction<a href="#1-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Introduction" title="Direct link to 1. Introduction">​</a></h2><p>Are you a beginner developer that lacks certain skills needed to land a job? But you feel that you could only gain those skills <strong>on</strong> the job itself?
If you answered “yes”, then you’re stuck in situation that I would call as the “<strong>skill paradox</strong>” <strong><em>—</em></strong> where you need skills to get a job, but those skills are the ones you would get if you had a job. It can generate a lot of stress and frustration when you start to realize that some skills cannot be obtained while working only on side hustles and therefore, you cannot learn only by yourself, but they’re generally required for job positions.</p><p>Collaboration and teamwork, learning how to code review (giving and receiving feedback), and getting started with bigger and existing codebases are things that cannot be taught while you work on some little projects. While, of course, you can learn those skills while getting a job in tech, sometimes those skills are necessary for you to get a job, making you stay in some kind of limbo where you need some skills to get a job, and those skills are precisely the ones you would get after the job.</p><p>In those cases, there’s still a way out of the limbo: you can contribute to open-source communities. Besides the value you are generating for the whole ecosystem, this can be an amazing selling point for your career and, since <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacktoberfest</a> is already around the corner, will be a great way to win a t-shirt or plant a tree too!</p><p>Now, let’s begin by teaching you how to actually do this.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-first-steps-on-open-source-contribution">2.

If you’re a beginner, you’re probably looking for projects that have a few characteristics:</p><ul><li>It’s actively maintained.</li><li>Has an open-source license that we can modify and use freely.</li><li>It’s not insanely big (since these projects can have some really hard things to accomplish before submitting something).</li><li>It must have good documentation on how to contribute.</li><li>It must have well-characterized issues in order for you to search for something (in the case that you haven’t found the problem itself).</li></ul><p>If you have matches in all of these points (or at least three of them), you’re good to go!</p><p>Throughout this article, I’m going to use our own repo, <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp Full-stack Framework</a>, since it gathers all the characteristics necessary for a good open-source repository. </p><p>So, let me show you how to find all these characteristics:</p><ul><li>It’s actively maintained and the owners of the repo reply and care for the issues!<ul><li>In the case of Wasp’s repo, the last commit was 13 hours ago, so, there’s definitely signs of life here!</li></ul></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gz3g6jl8hbvw66jmtizk.png" alt="Last commit" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li>It’s not insanely big → Comparing an exaggerated example with the Linux repo (if you check it, you’ll see that all pull requests there usually take a lot of time to be merged since the project is so big)</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2cp5ptn8uwzb9qv81sey.png" alt="Linux repo" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li>It’s good to have a documentation on how to contribute<ul><li>Searching for the docs, I found a file called <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> (which is a common name standard for contribution guidelines) and when we open it up:</li></ul></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8orfm43mllm2r5fs222o.png" alt="Contributing guidelines" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We have a whole documentation on how to start with things! Awesome!</p><ul><li>It’s good to have well characterized issues in order for you to search for something</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dk32gx185n9x9uoepobn.png" alt="Issues" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Searching for the issues, we can easily see that they’re all labeled and that will help us A TON!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="22-searching-for-issues">2.2. Searching for Issues<a href="#22-searching-for-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.2. Searching for Issues" title="Direct link to 2.2. Searching for Issues">​</a></h3><p>Great! Now that we have already chosen where we are going to contribute, let’s dive into the issues and search for something we want to do!</p><p>When searching for issues, the labels do us a great favor by already explicitly identifying all issues that can be good for newcomers! If you’re a beginner, <strong>good first issues</strong> and <strong>documentation</strong> are excellent labels for you to search for!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jdyigcuhobk75vsi37oi.png" alt="Good labels to search for" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yy6ek9gte26emr3bi182.png" alt="Issues on the repo labeled" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Opening the first issue, we can see that someone already manifested interest on it! So, since someone has already manifested interest in that one, let’s search for another one!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6phw5wcd5ik8bj8udj4u.png" alt="The first issue" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finding another issue — it doesn’t look like anyone is working on the one below, so we can take it ourselves!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k1o3v1r5yzzcmotjbiqi.png" alt="Finding another issue" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By the way, it's of absolute importance that, when you find an issue, you comment and set yourself as assignee in order to let other people know that you're going to take the task at hand!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h2t7qjpv9syc2hi09xai.png" alt="Communicating" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In this case, GitHub is a great platform for us to discuss, but sometimes authors can be hard to find. In these cases, search for a link or a way to contact them directly (in the case of Wasp, they have a <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> server, for example). Communicating your way through is really important to get things sorted out, and if you’re unsure of how to communicate well with people, you can read this other article <a href="https://dev.to/llxd/how-to-deal-with-people-communication-5gef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and start to get the hang of it!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-guidelines-for-contributing-to-open-source-projects">3. Guidelines for Contributing to Open-Source Projects<a href="#3-guidelines-for-contributing-to-open-source-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.

Reading the guidelines and writing some code" title="Direct link to 3.1. Reading the guidelines and writing some code">​</a></h3><p>Now that we have selected a repo, an issue to work on and communicated with the authors, it’s time to check the guidelines for making Pull Requests (if you don’t know what this means, it’s basically a request to merge your modifications to the codebase, you can check some more basic git terms <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> too). Sometimes, these guidelines are WAY too hard and sometimes they don’t even exist (that’s an awesome first issue actually), anyways look it up and see if you find something! </p><p>You can check Wasp’s contributing guidelines <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if you want to read it yourself! After reading it, it’s time to code the solution and get along with it.</p><p>Since the intent of this article is not to actually show the solving per se, I’ll skip this part and keep talking about the process itself. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="32-handling-code-reviews-and-feedback">3.2 Handling Code Reviews and Feedback<a href="#32-handling-code-reviews-and-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.2 Handling Code Reviews and Feedback" title="Direct link to 3.2 Handling Code Reviews and Feedback">​</a></h3><p>It’s not rare that when we code things up (especially in open-source projects), there will be some problems. Code reviews and feedback are an amazing way for us to get the bigger picture and improve our code quality, so let’s check on how to properly read and answer code reviews and feedback.</p><p>We’re generally used to receiving criticism in a harsh way, so, when someone approaches you with feedbacks, we generally move into our defense zone. Unfortunately, these cases can teach you the wrong things as it’s generally a good way to think of feedbacks as <strong>gifts</strong>! Someone spent some time writing (or speaking) things in order for you get even better on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p><p>This does not mean that all feedback is well-made or that people will always provide great feedback. Sometimes, people can be harsh. However, as you receive more and more feedbacks, you will develop a sense of which feedbacks are genuinely meant to help you improve and which are simply baseless criticism. It is crucial to be open to receiving constructive feedbacks and not take them personally.</p><p>Let’s see an example of code review and feedback here:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ezsocw81o9d90erstx3n.png" alt="Code Review Example" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is great feedback! It expresses the author’s opinion without being harsh and also suggests what to make in order to be perfect! The best way to answer this is simply:</p><ul><li>Thanking for the feedback</li><li>Saying your opinion (agree or disagree) when it makes sense</li><li>Work on it!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="showcasing-contributions">Showcasing Contributions<a href="#showcasing-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Showcasing Contributions" title="Direct link to Showcasing Contributions">​</a></h2><p>After all that work, it’s time for us to showcase our contributions! Document it all. <strong>GitHub</strong> (or other git platforms), <strong>personal portfolio sites, LinkedIn,</strong> and other means of reaching people have become as important as resumes nowadays, so it’s really nice to have some statistics and data to display on:</p><ul><li>What open-source projects have you worked on? Try to think of this as writing a story. First, start by giving the initial context of the project and how it’s revelatory.</li><li>How you contributed: Then, give the context of what you made, documentation, code, and problems you solved in general. Don’t forget to not focus a lot on the technical side since the person who could be reading this may not be technical.</li><li>How big was the impact? Talk about how this affected the ecosystem; it can be as big or as small as you like. Never neglect the impact that changing documentation can have (remember that for us, programmers, the documentation is our source of truth, and fixes there are greatly appreciated).</li></ul><p>Don’t forget to utilize the opportunity to engage with other developers and communities, make it so in order to get new connections and even greater opportunities later on! </p><p>Now that the theory is set, let’s check a few examples on how I would showcase a few of my contributions:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="case-1---a-big-contribution">Case 1 - A big contribution<a href="#case-1---a-big-contribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Case 1 - A big contribution" title="Direct link to Case 1 - A big contribution">​</a></h3><p>One of the ways to describe a big contribution is like this:</p><p>I made a few big contributions to a project called <strong><a href="https://coolify.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coolify</a></strong>, which was an open-source Heroku alternative. I refactored a lot of the UI, making it cleaner and more consistent throughout the application. Currently, more than 9000 instances are installed, and the UI affects all of them! You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/commits?author=LLxD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributions</a> here.</p><p>Of course, you can make this text as long or as short as you want, entering more detail about how this contribution was made and what exactly you did, but for this article, this is enough for you to get a general idea.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="case-2--a-small-contribution">Case 2- A small contribution<a href="#case-2--a-small-contribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Case 2- A small contribution" title="Direct link to Case 2- A small contribution">​</a></h3><p>One way to describe a small contribution is like this:</p><p>I made a small change to the new documentation for <a href="https://sequelize.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sequelize</a>! I was just scrolling through the documentation and found this mistake that could lead others to weird debugging sessions, so as soon as I found it, I submitted a PR for them! You can check out the contribution <a href="https://github.com/sequelize/website/commits?author=LLxD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>So, a lot was said, let’s make a quick recap on how to do contributions and how to showcase them:</p><ul><li>First of all, find a repo! If you don’t have any in mind, there loads of lists (like <a href="https://github.com/collections/choosing-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> one) that recommend some repos for you to take a look</li><li>Search for an issue that is not being made and you can work on it, if you’re beginner, check for <strong>documentation</strong> and <strong>good first issue</strong> labels</li><li>Comment and communicate that you’re going to fix the issue - take the opportunity to talk and get to know other developers</li><li>Code, get you PR reviewed and ready to merge after the feedbacks</li><li>Merge and showcase your contributions, showing that they are your way out of the Skill Paradox</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/04lotyojmwdnzt7b2s8j.png" alt="How to Open-Source" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The above steps can give you a really powerful experience in software engineering (which usually happens only when you’re already hired by a company). This is an awesome way to get some recognition while improving the open-source community — giving back to other developers and getting yourself out of the Skill Paradox!</p><p>And you? Have you contributed to open-source? Let me know in the comments below, and let’s share some experiences!</p>]]></content:encoded>

It basically enables ChatGPT functionality, but in the form of a callable API you can integrate into any app.</p><p>But when working with the API, a lot of devs wanted GPT to give back data in a format, like JSON, that they could use in their app’s functions.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you asked ChatGPT to return the data in a certain format, it wouldn’t always get it right. Which is why <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI released function calling</a>.</p><p>As they describe it, function calling allows devs to “… describe functions to&nbsp;GPT, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions.”</p><p>This is a great way to turn natural language into an API call.</p><p>So what better way to learn how to use GPT’s function calling feature than to use it to call <a href="https://imgflip.com/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imgflip.com’s meme creator API</a>!?</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0a0bc9uxabyg8cue2axu.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><a href="#lets-build" name="lets-build"></a>## Let’s Build<p>In this two-part tutorial, we’re going to build a full-stack React/NodeJS app with:</p><ul><li>Authentication</li><li>Meme generation via OpenAI’s function calling and ImgFlip.com’s API</li><li>Daily cron job to fetch new meme templates</li><li>Meme editing and deleting</li><li>and more!</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dwkbfq9kx8xlu7fb25v0.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I already deployed a working version of this app that you can try out here: <a href="https://damemerator.netlify.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://damemerator.netlify.app</a> — so give it a go and let’s get… going.</p><p>In Part 1 of this tutorial, we will get the app set up and generating and displaying memes. </p><p>In Part 2, we will add more functionality, like recurring cron jobs to fetch more meme templates, and the ability to edit and delete memes.</p><p>BTW, two quick tips:</p><ol><li>if you need to reference the app’s finished code at any time to help you with this tutorial, you can check out the app’s <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/memerator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Repo here</a>. </li><li>if you have any questions, feel free to hop into the <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp Discord Server</a> and ask us!</li></ol><h1>Part 1</h1><a href="#config" name="config"></a><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuration">Configuration<a href="#configuration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuration" title="Direct link to Configuration">​</a></h2><p>We’re going to make this a full-stack React/NodeJS web app so we need to get that set up first.

couple points:</p><ol><li>the <code>context</code> object is passed through to all Actions and Queries by Wasp. It contains the <a href="https://prisma.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a> client with access to the DB entities you defined in your  <code>main.wasp</code> config file.</li><li>We first look for the imgflip meme templates in our DB. If none are found, we fetch them using our <code>fetchTemplates</code> utility function we defined earlier. Then we <code>upsert</code> them into our DB.</li><li>There are some meme templates that take more than 2 text boxes, but for this tutorial we’re only using meme templates with 2 text inputs to make it easier.</li><li>We choose a random template from this list to use as a basis for our meme (it’s actually a great way to serendipitously generate some interesting meme content).</li><li>We give the OpenAI API info about the functions it can create arguments for via the <code>functions</code> and <code>function_call</code> properties, which tell it to always return JSON arguments for our function, <code>generateMemeImage</code></li></ol><p>Great! But once we start generating memes, we will need a way to display them on our front end.</p><p>So let’s now create a Wasp Query. A Query works just like an Action, except it’s only for <em>reading</em> data.</p><p>Go to <code>src/server</code> and create a new file called <code>queries.ts</code>.</p><p>Next, in your <code>main.wasp</code> file add the following code:</p><div class="language-tsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

to point out about this code:</p><ol><li>The <code>useQuery</code> hook calls our <code>getAllMemes</code> Query when the component mounts. It also caches the result for us, as well as automatically re-fetching whenever we add a new Meme to our DB via <code>createMeme</code>. This means our page will reload automatically whenever a new meme is generated.</li><li>The <code>useAuth</code> hook allows us to fetch info about our logged in user. If the user isn’t logged in, we force them to do so before they can generate a meme.</li></ol><p>These are really cool Wasp features that make your life as a developer a lot easier 🙂</p><p>So go ahead now and try and generate a meme. Here’s the one I just generated:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2ypm9n0uyra47mp5g85.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Haha. Pretty good!</p><p>Now wouldn’t it be cool though if we could edit and delete our memes? And what if we could expand the set of meme templates for our generator to use? Wouldn’t that be cool, too?</p><p>Yes, it would be. So let’s do that.</p><a href="#part-two" name="part-two"></a><h1>Part 2.</h1><p>So we’ve got ourselves a really good basis for an app at this point.</p><p>We’re using <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI’s function calling feature</a> to explain a function to GPT, and get it to return results for us in a format we can use to call that function.</p><p>This allows us to be certain GPT’s result will be usable in further parts of our application and opens up the door to creating AI agents.</p><p>If you think about it, we’ve basically got ourselves a really simple Meme generating “agent”. How cool is that?!</p><a href="#templates" name="templates"></a><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fetching--updating-templates-with-cron-jobs">Fetching &amp; Updating Templates with Cron Jobs<a href="#fetching--updating-templates-with-cron-jobs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fetching &amp; Updating Templates with Cron Jobs" title="Direct link to Fetching &amp; Updating Templates with Cron Jobs">​</a></h2><p>To be able to generate our meme images via <a href="https://imgflip.com/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImgFlip’s API</a>, we have to choose and send a meme template <code>id</code> to the API, along with the text arguments we want to fill it in with.</p><p>For example, the <code>Grandma Finds Internet</code> meme template has the following <code>id</code>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zoo4uainls9jxq7fzysv.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But the only way for us to get available meme templates from ImgFlip is to send a <code>GET</code> request to
<a href="https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes</a>. And according to ImgFlip, the <strong>/get-memes</strong> endpoint works like this:</p><blockquote><p>Gets an array of popular memes that may be captioned with this API. The size of this array and the order of memes may change at any time. When this description was written, it returned 100 memes ordered by how many times they were captioned in the last 30 days</p></blockquote><p>So it returns a list of the top 100 memes from the last 30 days. And as this is always changing, we can run a daily cron job to fetch the list and update our database with any new templates that don’t already exist in it.</p><p>We know this will work because the ImgFlip docs for the <strong>/caption-image</strong> endpoint — which we use to create a meme image — says this:</p><blockquote><p><em>key:</em> template_id
<em>value:</em> A template ID as returned by the <strong>get_memes</strong> response. Any ID that was ever returned from the <strong>get_memes</strong> response should work for this parameter…</p></blockquote><p>Awesome!</p><a href="#cron" name="cron"></a><h3 class="anchor

When I initially started writing this tutorial, I thought I’d also explain how to add <code>delete</code> meme functionality to the app as well.</p><p>But seeing as we’ve gotten this far, and as the entire two-part tutorial is pretty long, I figured you should be able to implement yourself by this point.</p><p>So I’ll leave you guide as to how to implement it yourself. Think of it as a bit of homework:</p><ol><li>define the <code>deleteMeme</code> Action in your <code>main.wasp</code> file</li><li>export the async function from the <code>actions.ts</code> file</li><li>import the Action in your client-side code</li><li>create a button which takes the meme’s <code>id</code> as an argument in your <code>deleteMeme</code> Action.</li></ol><p>If you get stuck, you can use the <code>editMeme</code> section as a guide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m an indiehacker that likes creating lots of fun side-projects, like my SaaS app <a href="https://CoverLetterGPT.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoverLetterGPT</a> with ~4,000 users. That’s why I've been on the lookout for AI-assisted coding tools to help me kickstart new full-stack web apps as quickly as possible.</p><p>I tried out a bunch, but found that most of them produced codebases that were too simple to work with, or getting a good result was just about as time consuming as coding it myself.</p><p>But through the process of trying out different tools and methods, I stumbled across a hack that helped me create comprehensive, functional codebases for full-stack apps with Auth, API routes, Tailwind CSS, DB management, and other more complex features.</p><p><strong>The trick?</strong> Ask <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> to write you a detailed Product Requirement Doc for the app you’d like to create, and then pass this to Wasp’s <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT Web App Generator</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/92bf5pjvdpfkdppcer0j.png" alt="Image description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The results are really surprising and give you a far better starter codebase than the other tools I’ve tried (mainly due to the specificity of the generator itself).</p><p>And best of all, its free to use! 🤑</p><h1>Intro</h1><p>I’m a self-taught, full-stack web developer and I have a lot of fun building side projects.</p><p>For example, the side project I’m most proud of is an open-source cover letter generator SaaS App, <a href="https://CoverLetterGPT.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoverLetterGPT</a>, which has close to 4,000 users!</p><p>I also have a lot of ridiculous side-project ideas, like <a href="https://boozetube.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this app</a> that can turn your favorite tech influencer’s YouTube videos into a drinking game. 🤣</p><p>That’s why I’ve been trying out lots of AI-assisted coding tools to generate <strong>fully-functional, full-stack web apps</strong> as quickly as possible.</p><p>There are the obvious tools at the moment, like using ChatGPT and Copilot within your IDE, but new ones are popping up all the time, especially those that act as AI assistants or “agents”.</p><p>I’ve gotten a chance to try out some of them, and I even wrote a long-form comparison piece where I put <a href="https://dev.to/wasp/smol-ai-vs-wasp-ai-which-is-the-better-ai-junior-developer-4fcb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two such tools to the test</a>, so check that out if you’re interested.</p><p><strong>But there’s a major problem with these tools</strong>: even though they’re able to generate some good boilerplate code, they often include a lot of errors and don’t make the developer's job <em>that</em> much easier in the end.</p><h1>Where the problem lies</h1><p>On paper, AI-assisted coding tools generally save devs time and effort, especially when it comes to isolated code snippets.</p><p>On one hand, we have tools like ChatGPT and Copilot, which aid you with refactoring, fixing errors, or generating a snippet of code. It's much like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, where the tools serve you the next piece that fits the immediate gap.</p><p>But coding isn't just about filling the next available space; it’s about <strong>envisioning the entire picture</strong>, understanding the broader system and how different pieces interrelate.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/SrnCKS6s02XT2tw6kz/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6b01lfcj3taubztyp823itz03hhy9qx8p0mslbtij&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media3.giphy.com/media/SrnCKS6s02XT2tw6kz/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6b01lfcj3taubztyp823itz03hhy9qx8p0mslbtij&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>AI-assisted coding tools that behave more like agents have the potential to understand this broader context needed to generate larger codebases, but it’s easier said than done. Currently, most of the tools out there end up generating code that comes full of errors.</p><p>Worst of all, some of the code they output can be so messy it actually means <em>more</em> work for you.</p><h1>How to fix it</h1><p>AI assistants, much like novice apprentices, need a comprehensive understanding of what they should work towards. To achieve this, you need to craft a detailed outline along with a comprehensive set of instructions to give the AI as much context as possible.</p><p>You essentially want to be taking on the role of a Product Manager/Designer and be giving the AI a <strong>Product Requirement Document (PRD)</strong>, i.e. an authoritative document that clearly outlines the</p><ul><li>purpose,
</li><li>features,
</li><li>functionality,
</li><li>and behavior
</li></ul><p>of the product to be developed.</p><p>But supplying the PRD is just half the battle. This is because components of your web app within the frontend and backend need to know about each other.</p><p>And this is where most of these tools fall short, with tools like <a href="https://github.com/smol-ai/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smol-Developer</a> creating decent client and server code that work great on their own, but unfortunately don’t work together!</p><p>Given this, it seems like an AI tool that already knows the ins and outs of the whole system, that understands the interconnectedness of various parts of a web app, is our best bet.</p><p>In short, we need a tool that doesn't just 'do its task' but 'understands the project'.</p><h1>The Best Tool for the Job: GPT Web App Generator.</h1><p>Remember, I’m focusing on generating comprehensive full-stack codebases here, and for that Wasp’s <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT Web App Generator</a> gets the job done surprisingly well.</p><p>How does it do this? Well, the full answer lies in how <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> as a framework is able to help you build full-stack React/NodeJS web apps.</p><p>It’s beyond the scope of this article to <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explain it in full detail</a>, but the TL;DR is that Wasp has a compiler that helps build your app based on a config file. The config file is like a set of <strong>instructions</strong> that its compiler understands and uses to piece together the different parts of the full-stack app for you.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/heVoZxS2qAGk4Ay5E5/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6x2abm5omkgd1d79rz6dt5kzaead3mxu8xt4xuwc2&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media1.giphy.com/media/heVoZxS2qAGk4Ay5E5/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6x2abm5omkgd1d79rz6dt5kzaead3mxu8xt4xuwc2&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is what makes it easier for the AI to get all the pieces of the app right! Once it writes the fundamental client and server code, along with the main config file, the Wasp compiler takes over and pieces it all together, removing a lot of potential possibilities for errors!</p><p>In the end, you get a React/NodeJS codebase with features like:</p><ol><li>full-stack auth</li><li>server config and API routes</li><li>tailwind CSS config and styles</li><li>cron jobs and queues</li><li>email sending</li><li>deployment</li></ol><p>What’s cool too is that this tool doesn't require you to be highly explicit, <a href="https://dev.to/wasp/how-we-built-a-gpt-code-agent-that-generates-full-stack-web-apps-in-react-nodejs-explained-simply-4f9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">because the specifics are baked into the tool itself</a>. In other words, <strong>it saves you tons of time and energy without compromising on the quality or coherence of the end product.</strong></p><h1>The Hack: Getting GPT to write the PRD for you</h1><p>Ok, but if you’re like me, you don’t really know how to write a good PRD. Plus, writing a detailed PRD can be pretty time-consuming. But luckily ChatGPT knows how.</p><p>Thanks, ChatGPT 🙏</p><p>So to get really great results out of Wasp’s <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT Web App Generator</a>, I first ask <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> (using GPT-4) to write a detailed product requirement doc for me, like this:</p><div class="language-plaintext codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-plaintext codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Write a Product Requirement Document for the following full-stack app:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">An app where users can track their house plants and their watering schedule.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>And then I’ll slightly modify ChatGPT’s output before I pass it to GPT Web App Generator:</p><div class="language-plaintext codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-plaintext codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Product Requirements Document for a House Plants Tracking Application</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">1. **Product Title**: GreenLush: Your House Plant Care Companion</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">2. **Purpose**: </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">The GreenLush app is designed to help users manage their house plants and keep track of their watering schedules.

            <description><![CDATA[TL;DR]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TL;DR" title="Direct link to TL;DR">​</a></h2><p>WebSockets allow your app to have “real time” features, where updates are instant because they’re passed on an open, two-way channel. This is a different from CRUD apps, which usually use HTTP requests that must establish a connection, send a request, receive a response, and then close the connection.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:550px" src="/img/websockets-app/Untitled.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>To use WebSockets in your React app, you’ll need a dedicated server, such as an ExpressJS app with NodeJS, in order to maintain a persistent connection.</p><p>Unfortunately, serverless solutions (e.g. NextJS, AWS lambda) don’t natively support WebSockets. Bummer. 😞 </p><p>Why not? Well, serverless services turn on and off depending on if a request is coming in. With WebSockets, we need this “always on” connection that only a dedicated server can provide (although you can pay for third-party services as a workaround).</p><p>Luckily, we’re going to talk about two great ways you can implement them:</p><ol><li><strong>Advanced</strong>: Implementing and configuring it yourself with React, NodeJS, and Socket.IO</li><li><strong>Easy</strong>: By using <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>, a full-stack React-NodeJS framework, to configure and integrate Socket.IO into your app for you.</li></ol><p>These methods allow you to build fun stuff, like this instantly updating “voting with friends” app we built here:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Twy-2P0Co6M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><p>You can try out the <a href="https://websockets-voting-client.fly.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live demo app here</a>.<br>
<!-- -->And if you just want the app code, it's <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/websockets-wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available here on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-websockets">Why WebSockets?<a href="#why-websockets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why WebSockets?" title="Direct link to Why WebSockets?">​</a></h2><p>So, imagine you're at a party sending text messages to a friend to tell them what food to bring. </p><p>Now, wouldn’t it be easier if you called your friend on the phone so you could talk constantly,  instead of sending sporadic messages? That's pretty much what WebSockets are in the world of web applications. </p><p>For example, traditional HTTP requests (e.g. CRUD/RESTful) are like those text messages — your app has to <strong>ask the server</strong> every time it wants new information, just like you had to send a text message to your friend every time you thought of food for your party. </p><p>But with WebSockets, once a connection is established, it <strong>remains open</strong> for constant, two-way communication, so the server can send new information to your app the instant it becomes available, even if the client didn’t ask for it. </p><p>This is perfect for real-time applications like chat apps, game servers, or when you're keeping track of stock prices. For example, apps like Google Docs, Slack, WhatsApp, Uber, Zoom, and Robinhood all use WebSockets to power their real-time communication features.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/26u4hHj87jMePiO3u/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6hxgjnub1rcs80udcj652956fwmm4qhxsmk6ldxg7&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media3.giphy.com/media/26u4hHj87jMePiO3u/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6hxgjnub1rcs80udcj652956fwmm4qhxsmk6ldxg7&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So remember, when your app and server have a lot to talk about, go for WebSockets and let the conversation flow freely!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-websockets-work">How WebSockets Work<a href="#how-websockets-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How WebSockets Work" title="Direct link to How WebSockets Work">​</a></h2><p>If you want real-time capabilities in your app, you don’t always need WebSockets.

It’s as if they “turn on” when the request comes in, and then “turn off” once it’s completed.</p><p>This serverless architecture is not ideal for keeping a WebSocket connection alive because we want a persistent, “always-on” connection.</p><p>That’s why you need a “serverful” architecture if you want to build real-time apps. And although there is a workaround to getting WebSockets on a serverless architecture, <a href="https://vercel.com/guides/do-vercel-serverless-functions-support-websocket-connections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like using third-party services</a>, this has a number of drawbacks:</p><ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> these services exist as subscriptions and can get costly as your app scales</li><li><strong>Limited Customization:</strong> you’re using a pre-built solution, so you have less control</li><li><strong>Debugging:</strong> fixing errors gets more difficult, as your app is not running locally</li></ul><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:550px" src="/img/websockets-app/Untitled 2.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-expressjs-with-socketio---complexcustomizable-method">Using ExpressJS with Socket.IO  — Complex/Customizable Method<a href="#using-expressjs-with-socketio---complexcustomizable-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using ExpressJS with Socket.IO  — Complex/Customizable Method" title="Direct link to Using ExpressJS with Socket.IO  — Complex/Customizable Method">​</a></h3><p>Okay, let's start with the first, more traditional approach: creating a dedicated server for your client to establish a two-way communication channel with.</p><p>This method is more advanced and involves a bit more complexity, but allows for more fine-tuned customization. <strong>If you're looking for a straightforward, easier way to bring WebSockets to your React/NodeJS app, we'll get to that in the <a href="#implementing-websockets-with-wasp--easierless-config-method">section below</a></strong></p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>👨‍💻 If you want to code along you can follow the instructions below.

You can check this by refreshing the page and voting again. You’ll see the votes just add up, as we’re creating a new random user each time. We don’t want that! </p><p>We should instead be authenticating and persisting a session for a user that’s registered in our database. But another problem: we don’t even have a database at all in this app!</p><p>You can start to see the how the complexity add ups for even just a simple voting feature</p><p>Luckily, our next solution, Wasp, has integrated Authentication and Database Management.

Let’s give a quick run-down of the advantages and disadvantages of both the implementations above.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Without Wasp</th><th>With Wasp</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>😎&nbsp;Intended User</td><td>Senior Developers, web development teams</td><td>Full-stack developers, “Indiehackers”, junior devs</td></tr><tr><td>📈&nbsp;Complexity of Code</td><td>Medium-to-High</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>🚤&nbsp;Speed</td><td>Slower, more methodical</td><td>Faster, more integrated</td></tr><tr><td>🧑‍💻&nbsp;Libraries</td><td>Any</td><td>Socket.IO</td></tr><tr><td>⛑&nbsp;Type safety</td><td>Implement on both server and client</td><td>Implement once on server, inferred by Wasp on client</td></tr><tr><td>🎮&nbsp;Amount of control</td><td>High, as you determine the implementation</td><td>Opinionated, as Wasp decides the basic implementation</td></tr><tr><td>🐛&nbsp;Learning Curve</td><td>Complex: full knowledge of front and backend technologies, including WebSockets</td><td>Intermediate: Knowledge of full-stack fundamentals necessary.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-websockets-using-react-expressjs-without-wasp">Implementing WebSockets Using React, Express.js (Without Wasp)<a href="#implementing-websockets-using-react-expressjs-without-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementing WebSockets Using React, Express.js (Without Wasp)" title="Direct link to Implementing WebSockets Using React, Express.js (Without Wasp)">​</a></h3><p>Advantages:</p><ol><li>Control &amp; <strong>Flexibility</strong>: You can approach the implementation of WebSockets in the way that best suits your project's needs, as well as your choice between a <a href="https://www.atatus.com/blog/websocket-libraries-for-nodejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of different WebSocket libraries</a>, not just Socket.IO.</li></ol><p>Disadvantages:</p><ol><li><strong>More Code &amp; Complexity</strong>: Without the abstractions provided by a framework like Wasp, you might need to write more code and create your own abstractions to handle common tasks. Not to mention the proper configuration of a NodeJS/ExpressJS server (the one provided in the example is very basic)</li><li>Manual <strong>Type Safety: If you’re working with TypeScript, you have to be more careful typing your  event handlers and payload types coming into and going out from the server, or implement a more type-safe approach yourself.</strong></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-websockets-with-wasp-uses-react-expressjs-and-socketio-under-the-hood">Implementing WebSockets with Wasp (uses React, ExpressJS, and <a href="http://Socket.IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Socket.IO</a> under the hood)<a href="#implementing-websockets-with-wasp-uses-react-expressjs-and-socketio-under-the-hood" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to implementing-websockets-with-wasp-uses-react-expressjs-and-socketio-under-the-hood" title="Direct link to implementing-websockets-with-wasp-uses-react-expressjs-and-socketio-under-the-hood">​</a></h3><p>Advantages:</p><ol><li>Fully-Integrated<strong>/Less code</strong>: Wasp provides useful abstractions such as <code>useSocket</code> and <code>useSocketListener</code> hooks for use in React components (on top of other features like Auth, Async Jobs, Email-sending, DB management, and Deployment), simplifying the client-side code, and allowing for full integration with less configuration.</li><li><strong>Type Safety</strong>: Wasp facilitates full-stack type safety for WebSocket events and payloads. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors due to mismatched data types and saves you from writing even more boilerplate.</li></ol><p>Disadvantages:</p><ol><li><strong>Learning curve</strong>: Developers unfamiliar with Wasp will need to learn the framework to effectively use it.</li><li><strong>Less control</strong>: While Wasp provides a lot of conveniences, it abstracts away some of the details, giving developers slightly less control over certain aspects of socket management.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>In general, how you add WebSockets to your React app depends on the specifics of your project, your comfort level with the available tools, and the trade-offs you're willing to make between ease of use, control, and complexity.</p><p>Don’t forget, if you want to check out the full finished code from our “Lunch Voting” example full-stack app, go here: <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/websockets-wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/vincanger/websockets-wasp</a></p><p>And if you know of a better, cooler, sleeker way of implementing WebSockets into your apps, let us know in the comments below</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:550px" src="/img/websockets-app/Untitled 7.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[TL;DR]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">TL;DR<a href="#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TL;DR" title="Direct link to TL;DR">​</a></h3><p>AI-assisted coding tools are on the rise. In this article, we take a deep dive into two tools that use similar techniques, but are intended for different outcomes. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/smol-ai/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smol AI’s “Smol-Developer”</a> gained a lot of notoriety very quickly by being one of the first such tools on the scene. It is a simple set of python scripts that allow a user to build prototype apps using natural language in an iterative approach. </p><p><a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp’s “GPT Web App Generator”</a> is more of a newcomer and focuses on building more complex full-stack React + NodeJS web app prototypes through a simple prompt and fancy UI.</p><p>When comparing the two, Smol-Developer’s strength is its <strong>versatility</strong>. If you want to spend time tinkering and tweaking, you can do a lot to your own prompting, and even the code, in order to get decent results on a <strong>broad range of apps</strong>. </p><p>On the other hand, Wasp AI shines by being <strong>specific.</strong> Because it’s only built for generating full-stack React/NodeJS/Prisma/Tailwind codebases, it does the tweaking and advanced prompting for you, and thus it performs much better in generating <strong>higher quality content</strong> with less effort for a specific use case.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:550px" src="/img/smol-ai-vs-wasp-ai/Untitled.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Will either of these tools completely replace Junior Developers in their current form? Of course not. But they do allow for rapid prototyping and testing of novel ideas.</p><p>Read on to learn more about how they work, which tool is right for the job at hand, and how you can use them in your current workflow.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Intro" title="Direct link to Intro">​</a></h2><p>The age of AI-assisted coding tools is fully upon us. GitHub’s Copilot might be the go-to professional solution, but since its release numerous open-source solutions have popped up.</p><p>Most of these newer solutions tend towards functioning as an AI Agent, going beyond just suggesting the next logical pieces of code within your current file, they aim to create simple prototypes of entire apps. Some are focused more on scaffolding entire app prototypes from an initial prompt, while others function as interactive assistants, helping you modify and improve existing codebases. </p><p>Either way, they’re often being described as “AI Junior Developers”, because they can take a product requirement (i.e. “prompt”) and build a pretty good — but far from perfect — first iteration, saving developers a lot of time.</p><p>This article is going to focus on two tools that aim to build somewhat complex working prototypes from a single prompt: <a href="https://github.com/smol-ai/developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smol AI</a> and <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp AI</a>. We’ll test them out by running the same prompts through each and seeing what we get.</p><p>By the end of it, you’ll have a pretty good understanding of how they work, their advantages and disadvantages, and what kind of tasks they’re best suited for.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-we-begin">Before We Begin<a href="#before-we-begin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before We Begin" title="Direct link to Before We Begin">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp = }</a> is the only open-source, completely serverful fullstack React/Node framework with a built-in compiler and AI-assisted features that lets you build your app super quickly. </p><p>We’re working hard to help you build performant web apps as easily as possible — including creating content like this, which is released weekly!</p><p>We would be super grateful if you could help us out by starring our repo on GitHub: <a href="https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a> 🙏</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5b1bjvpt97e7o2psgle7.gif" alt="please please please" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>…e<em>ven Ron would star <a href="https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp on GitHub</a></em> 🤩</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-tools">The Tools<a href="#the-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Tools" title="Direct link to The Tools">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smol-developer">Smol-Developer<a href="#smol-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smol-Developer" title="Direct link to Smol-Developer">​</a></h3><p>Smol AI (described as a platform for “model distillation and AI developer agents”) actually has a few open-source tools on offer, but Smol-Developer is the one we’ll be taking a look at. It was initially released by <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swyx</a> on May 11th and already has over 10k GitHub stars!</p><p>It aims to be a generalist, prompt-based coding assistant run from the command line. The developer’s job becomes a process of iterative prompting, testing, and re-prompting in order to get the optimal output. It is not limited to any language or type of app it can create, although simple apps tend to work best.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:400px" src="/img/smol-ai-vs-wasp-ai/smol-ai-tweet.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Check out this tweet thread above to get a better understanding: <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1657892220492738560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1657892220492738560</a></p><p>Running from the command line, Smol AI is essentially a chain of calls to the OpenAI chat completions (i.e. “ChatGpt”) endpoint via a python script that:</p><ol><li>takes an initial user-generated prompt</li><li>creates a plan based on internal prompts* for executing the app with:<ol><li>the structure of the entire app </li><li>each file and its exported variables to be generated</li><li>function names</li></ol></li><li>generates file paths based on the plan</li><li>loops through file paths and generates code for each file based on plan and prompt</li></ol><p>The generated output can then be evaluated by the developer and the prompt can be iterated on to account for any errors or bugs found during runtime.</p><p>Smol-Developer quickly gained notoriety by being one of the first of such tools on the scene, in addition to Swyx’s prominence within it. So if you’re curious to see what’s being built with it, just check out some of the numerous YouTube videos on it. </p><p>One of my personal favorites is AI Jason’s exposé and commentary.

Using this approach, Wasp simplifies the web app creation process by handling boilerplate code for you, taking the core app logic written by the developer and connecting the entire stack together from frontend to backend, and database management. </p><p>It currently works with React, NodeJS, Tanstack-Query, and Prisma, taking care of features like Auth, Routing, Cron Jobs, Fullstack Typesafety, and Caching. This allows developers to focus more on the fun stuff, like the app’s features, instead of spending time on boring configurations.</p><p>Because Wasp uses a compiler and config file to generate the app from, this makes it surprisingly well suited for guiding LLMs like ChatGPT towards creating more complex apps with it, as it essentially a plan or set of instructions for how to build the app!</p><p>Take this simple example of how you’d tell Wasp that you want <code>username and password</code> authentication in your app:</p><div class="language-jsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0

The right paddle is controlled by a simple AI algorithm, which slowly moves the paddle toward the ball at every frame, with some probability of error. Make the canvas a 400 x 400 black square and center it in the app. Make the paddles 100px long, yellow and the ball small and red. Make sure to render the paddles and name them so they can controlled in javascript. Implement the collision detection and scoring as well.

Because more work is being done by Wasp’s compiler and less by GPT, each app costs about ~$0.10-$0.20 to generate (although Wasp covers the cost and allows you to use it for free), whereas to generate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxyqz6SYp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complex full-stack apps with Smol-Developer can cost upwards of ~$10.00</a>!</p></div></div><p>Plus, there are plenty of YouTubers who’ve created videos about the process of using Smol-Developer and it seems they all come to similar conclusions: you need to create a very detailed and explicit prompt in order to get a working prototype (In fact, in AI Jason’s Smol-AI video above, he mentioned that he got the best results out of the box when prompting Smol-Developer to write everything to one file only — of course this limits you to generating simple apps only that are not so easy to continue from manually).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thoughts--further-considerations">Thoughts &amp; Further Considerations<a href="#thoughts--further-considerations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thoughts &amp; Further Considerations" title="Direct link to Thoughts &amp; Further Considerations">​</a></h2><p>At their core, SmolAI and WaspAI function quite similarly, by first prompting the LLM to create a plan for the app’s architecture, and then to execute on that plan, file by file. </p><p>But because Smol-Developer aims to be able to generate a wider range of apps, the expectation is on the Developer (or “Prompt Engineer”) to create a highly detailed, explicit prompt, which is more akin to a Product Requirement Doc that a Product Designer would write. This can take a few iterations to get right and pushes Smol-Developer in the direction of “Natural Language Programming” tool.</p><p>On the other hand, Wasp’s GPT Web App Generator has a lot of prompting and programming going on behind the scenes, abstracted away from the user and hidden within the Generator’s code and Wasp’s compiler. Wasp comes with a lot of knowledge baked in and already has a good idea of what it wants to build, which means the user has less to think about it. This means that we’re more likely to get a working complex prototype from a short, simple prompt, but we have less flexibility in the kinds of apps we’re able to create — we always get a full-stack web app.</p><p>In general, Wasp is like a junior developer specialized in web dev and has a lot of experience with a specific stack, while Smol AI is a junior developer that’s a generalist who is more versatile, but has less specific knowledge and experience with web dev 🙂</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Smol AI</th><th>Wasp AI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🧑‍💻&nbsp;Types of Apps</td><td>Varied</td><td>Full-stack Web Apps</td></tr><tr><td>🗯&nbsp;Programming Languages</td><td>All Types</td><td>JavaScript/TypeScript</td></tr><tr><td>📈&nbsp;Complexity of Generated App</td><td>Simple to Medium</td><td>Medium to Complex</td></tr><tr><td>💰&nbsp;Price per Generation — via OpenAI’s API</td><td>$0.80 to $10.00</td><td>$0.10 to $0.20&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>💳&nbsp;Payment Method</td><td>bring your own API key</td><td>free — paid for by Wasp</td></tr><tr><td>🐛&nbsp;Debugging</td><td>Yes, if you’re willing to tinker</td><td>Built-in, but limited</td></tr><tr><td>🗣&nbsp;Type of Prompt Needed</td><td>Complex and detailed, 1 or more pages (e.g. an entire Product Requirement Doc)</td><td>Simple, 1-3 paragraphs</td></tr><tr><td>😎&nbsp;Intended User</td><td>Engineers, Product Designers wanting to generate a broad range of simple prototypes</td><td>Web Devs, Product Designers that want a feature rich full-stack web app prototype</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Other big differences lie within: </p><ol><li>Error Correction upon Code Creation<ol><li>Smol AI initially had a debugging script, but this has temporarily deprecated due to the fact that it expects the entire codebase when debugging, and current 32k and 100k token context windows are only available in private beta for GPT4 and Anthropic at the moment.</li><li>Wasp AI has some error correction baked into its process, as the structure of a Wasp app is more defined and the range of errors are more predictable.</li></ol></li><li>Price per app generation via OpenAI’s chat completion endpoints <ol><li>Smol AI can cost anywhere from <strong>~$0.80 to $10.00</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsxyqz6SYp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depending on the complexity of the app</a>.</li><li>Wasp AI costs ~<strong>$0.10 to $0.20</strong>&nbsp;per app, when using the default mix of GPT 4 and GPT 3.5 turbo, but Wasp covers the bill here. If you choose to run <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/#:~:text=%5B-,Advanced,-%5D%20Can%20I%20use" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it just with GPT4</a>, then the cost is 10x at&nbsp;<strong>$1.00 to $2.00</strong> per generation and you have to provide your own API key.</li></ol></li><li>User Interface<ol><li>Smol Developer works through the command line and has minimal logging and process feedback</li><li>Wasp AI currently uses a clean web app UI with more logging and feedback, as well as through the command line without a UI (you have to download the <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/#:~:text=%5BAdvanced%5D%20Can%20I%20use%20GPT4%20for%20the%20whole%20app%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experimental Wasp release</a> to do so at this time).</li></ol></li></ol><p>Overall, both solutions produce amazing results, allowing solo developers or teams iterate on ideas and generate prototypes faster than before. But they still have a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>For example, what these tools lack the most at the moment is in interactive debugging and incremental generation. It would be great if they could allow the user to generate additional code and fix problems in the codebase on the fly, rather than having to go back, rewrite the prompt, and regenerate an entire new codebase.</p><p>I’m not aware of the Smol AI roadmap, but seeing that it’s received a grant from <a href="https://vercel.com/blog/ai-accelerator-participants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel’s AI accelerator program,</a> I’m sure we will be seeing development on it continue and the tool improve (let me know in the comments if you do have some insight here).</p><p>On the other hand, as I’m a member of the Wasp team, I can confidently say that Wasp will soon be adding the initial generation process and interactive debugging into Wasp’s command line interface!</p><p>So I definitely think it’s early days and that these tools will continue to progress — and continue to produce more impressive results 🚀</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="which-tool-should-you-use">Which Tool Should You Use?<a href="#which-tool-should-you-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Which Tool Should You Use?" title="Direct link to Which Tool Should You Use?">​</a></h2><p>Obviously, there can be no clear winner here as the answer to question of which tool you should use as your next “AI Junior Developer” depends largely on your goals.</p><p>Are you looking for a tool that can generate a broad range of simple apps?

This is all connected together with the Wasp framework.</p><p>You can see an example of generated codebase here: <a href="https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/result/07ed440a-3155-4969-b3f5-2031fb1f622f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://magic-app-generator.wasp-lang.dev/result/07ed440a-3155-4969-b3f5-2031fb1f622f</a> .</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img src="/img/how-we-built-gpt-wasp/todo-results.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Result of generating a Todo app</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Generator does its best to produce code that works out of the box → you can download it to your machine and run it.

For even more complex apps, it usually doesn’t follow up completely, but stops at some level of complexity and fills in the rest with TODOs or omits functionality, so it is kind of like a simplified model of what was asked for. Overall, it is optimized for producing CRUD business web apps.</p><p>This makes it a great tool for kick-starting your next web app project with a solid prototype, or to even generate working, simple apps on the fly!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-it-work-️">How does it work ⚙️?<a href="#how-does-it-work-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does it work ⚙️?" title="Direct link to How does it work ⚙️?">​</a></h2><p>When we set out to build the Generator, we gave ourselves the following goals:</p><ul><li>we must be able to build it in a couple of weeks</li><li>it has to be relatively easy to maintain in the future</li><li>it needs to generate the app quickly and cheaply (a couple of minutes, &lt; $1)</li><li>generated apps should have as few mistakes as possible</li></ul><p>Therefore, to keep it simple, we don’t do any LLM-level engineering or fine-tuning, instead, <strong>we just use OpenAI API (specifically GPT3.5 and GPT4) to generate different parts of the app while giving it the right context at every moment (pieces of docs, examples, guidelines, …)</strong>. To ensure the coherence and quality of the generated app, we don’t give our code agent too much freedom but instead heavily guide it, step by step, through generating the app.</p><p>As <strong>step zero</strong>, we generate some code files deterministically, without GPT, just based on the options that the user chose (primary color, auth method): those include some config files for the project, some basic global CSS, and some auth logic. You can see this logic here (we call those “skeleton” files): <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/737ab428edf38f245cd9f8db60b637b723352e55/waspc/src/Wasp/AI/GenerateNewProject/Skeleton.hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code on Github</a> .</p><p>Then, the code agent takes over!</p><p><strong>The code agent does its work in 3 main phases</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Planning 📝</strong></li><li><strong>Generating 🏭</strong></li><li><strong>Fixing 🔧</strong></li></ol><p>Since GPT4 is quite slower and significantly more expensive than GPT3.5 (also has a lower rate limit regarding the number of tokens per minute, and also the number of requests per minute), we use GPT4 only for the planning, since that is the crucial step, and then after that, we use GPT3.5 for the rest.</p><p>As for <strong>cost per app</strong> 💸: one app typically consumes from 25k to 60k tokens, which comes to about <strong>$0.1 to $0.2</strong> per app, when we use a mix of GPT4 and GPT3.5. If we run it just with GPT4, then the cost is 10x, which is from <strong>$1 to $2</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-intermezzo-short-explanation-of-openai-chat-completions-api">🎶 Intermezzo: short explanation of OpenAI Chat Completions API<a href="#-intermezzo-short-explanation-of-openai-chat-completions-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎶 Intermezzo: short explanation of OpenAI Chat Completions API" title="Direct link to 🎶 Intermezzo: short explanation of OpenAI Chat Completions API">​</a></h3><p>OpenAI API offers different services, but we used only one of them: “chat completions”.</p><p><strong>API itself is actually very simple: you send over a conversation, and you get a response from the GPT.</strong></p><p>The conversation is just a list of messages, where each message has content and a role, where the role specifies who “said” that content → was it “user” (you), or “assistant” (GPT).</p><p>The important thing to note is that <strong>there is no concept of state/memory: every API call is completely standalone</strong>, and the only thing that GPT knows about is the conversation you provide it with at that moment!</p><p>If you are wondering how ChatGPT (the web app that uses GPT in the background) works with no memory → well, each time you write a message, the whole conversation so far is resent again!

We also wrote some <strong>simple heuristics of our own that are able to detect some of the common mistakes</strong>.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img src="/img/how-we-built-gpt-wasp/gen-logs-fixing.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/737ab428edf38f245cd9f8db60b637b723352e55/waspc/src/Wasp/AI/GenerateNewProject/PageComponentFile.hs#L122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our code (&amp; prompt) for fixing a Page</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/737ab428edf38f245cd9f8db60b637b723352e55/waspc/src/Wasp/AI/GenerateNewProject/OperationsJsFile.hs#L26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our code (&amp; prompt) for fixing Operations</a>.</p><p>In the prompt, we would usually repeat the same guidelines we provided previously in the Generation step, while also adding a couple of additional pointers to common mistakes, and that usually helps, it fixes stuff it missed before.

Even GPT4 wasn’t perfect in this situation. For such situations, when possible, we ended up writing <strong>our own heuristics that would fix those mistakes</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/737ab428edf38f245cd9f8db60b637b723352e55/waspc/src/Wasp/AI/GenerateNewProject/PageComponentFile.hs#L49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixing JS imports</a>).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="things-we-triedlearned">Things we tried/learned<a href="#things-we-triedlearned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Things we tried/learned" title="Direct link to Things we tried/learned">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="explanations-">Explanations 💬<a href="#explanations-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Explanations 💬" title="Direct link to Explanations 💬">​</a></h3><p>We tried telling GPT to explain what it did while fixing mistakes: which mistakes it will fix, and which mistakes it fixed, since we read that that can help, but <strong>we didn’t see visible improvement in its performance</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-">Testing 🧪<a href="#testing-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testing 🧪" title="Direct link to Testing 🧪">​</a></h3><p>Testing the performance of your code agent is hard.</p><p>In our case, it takes a couple of minutes for our code agent to generate a new app, and you need to run tests directly with the OpenAI API. Also, <strong>since results are non-deterministic, it can be pretty hard to say if output was affected by the changes</strong> you did or not.</p><p>Finally, evaluating the output itself can be hard (especially in our case when it is a whole full-stack web app).</p><p>Ideally, we would have set up a system where we can run only parts of the whole generation process, and we could automatically run a specific part a number of times for each of different sets of parameters (which would include different prompts, but also parameters like type of model (gpt4 vs gpt3.5), temperature and similar), in order to compare performance for each of those parameter sets.</p><p>Evaluation performance would also ideally be automated, e.g. we would count the mistakes during compilation and/or evaluate the quality of app design → but this is also quite hard.</p><p>We, unfortunately, didn’t have time to set up such a system, so <strong>we were mostly doing testing manually, which is quite subjective and vulnerable to randomness</strong>, and is effective only for changes that have quite a big impact, while you can’t really detect those that are minor optimizations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context-vs-smarts-">Context vs smarts 🧠<a href="#context-vs-smarts-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Context vs smarts 🧠" title="Direct link to Context vs smarts 🧠">​</a></h3><p>When we started working on the Generator, we thought the size of GPT’s context would be the main issue. However, we didn’t have any issues with context at the end → most of what we wanted to specify would fit into 2k to max 4k tokens, while GPT3.5 has context up to 16k!</p><p>Instead, <strong>we had bigger problems with its “smarts”</strong> → meaning that GPT would not follow the rules we very explicitly told it to follow, or would do things we explicitly forbid it from doing. GPT4 proved to be better at following rules than GPT3.5, but even GPT4 would keep doing some mistakes over and over and forgetting about specific rules (even though there was more than enough context). The “fixing” step did help with this: we would repeat the rules there and GPT would pick up more of them, but often still not all of them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="handling-json-as-a-response-">Handling JSON as a response 📋<a href="#handling-json-as-a-response-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Handling JSON as a response 📋" title="Direct link to Handling JSON as a response 📋">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned earlier in this article, in all our interactions with GPT, we always ask it to return the response as JSON, for which we specify the schema and give some examples.</p><p>However, GPT still doesn’t always follow that rule, and will sometimes add some text around the JSON, or will make a mistake in formatting JSON.</p><p>The way we handled this is with two simple fixes:</p><ol><li>Upon receiving JSON, we would remove all the characters from the start until we hit <code>{</code>, and also all chars from the end until we hit <code>}</code>. Simple heuristic, but it works very well for removing redundant text around the JSON in practice since GPT will normally not have any <code>{</code> or <code>}</code> in that text.</li><li>If we fail to parse JSON, we send it again for repairs, to GPT. We include the previous prompt and its last answer (that contains invalid JSON) and add instructions to fix it + JSON parse errors we got. We repeat this a couple of times until it gets it right (or until we give up).</li></ol><p>In practice, <strong>these two methods took care of invalid JSON in 99% of the cases for us</strong>.</p><p>NOTE: While we were implementing our code agent, OpenAI released new functionality for GPT, “functions”, which is basically a mechanism to have GPT respond with a structured JSON, following the schema of your description. So it would likely make more sense to do this with “functions”, but we already had this working well so we just stuck with it.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="handling-interruptions-in-the-service-">Handling interruptions in the service 🚧<a href="#handling-interruptions-in-the-service-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Handling interruptions in the service 🚧" title="Direct link to Handling interruptions in the service 🚧">​</a></h3><p>We were calling OpenAI API directly, so we noticed quickly that often it would return 503 - service unavailable - especially during peak hours (e.g. 3 pm CET).</p><p>Therefore, it is recommended to have some kind of retry mechanism, ideally with exponential backoff, that makes your code agent redundant to such random interruptions in the service, and also to potential rate limiting. <strong>We went with the retry mechanism with exponential backoff and it worked great</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="temperature-️">Temperature 🌡️<a href="#temperature-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Temperature 🌡️" title="Direct link to Temperature 🌡️">​</a></h3><p>Temperature determines how creative GPT is, but the more creative it gets, the less “stable” it is. It hallucinates more and also has a harder time following rules.
A temperature is a number from 0 to 2, with a default value of 1.</p><p>We experimented with different values and found the following:</p><ul><li><strong>≥ 1.5</strong> would every so and so start giving quite silly results with random strings in it.</li><li><strong>≥ 1.0, &lt; 1.5</strong> was okish but was introducing a bit too many mistakes.</li><li><strong>≥ 0.7, &lt; 1.0</strong> was optimal → creative enough, while still not having many mistakes.</li><li><strong>≤ 0.7</strong> seemed to perform similarly to a bit higher values, but with a bit less creativity maybe.</li></ul><p>That said, I don’t think we tested values below 0.7 enough, and that is something we could certainly work on more.</p><p><strong>We ended up using 0.7 as our default value, except for prompts that do fixing, for those we used a lower value of 0.5</strong> because it seemed like GPT was changing stuff too much while fixing at 0.7 (being too creative). Our logic was: let it be creative when writing the first version of the code, then have it be a bit more conventional while fixing it. Again, we haven’t tested all this enough, so this is certainly something I would like us to explore more. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future-">Future 🔮<a href="#future-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future 🔮" title="Direct link to Future 🔮">​</a></h2><p>While we ended up being impressed with the performance of what we managed to build in such a short time, we were also left wanting to try so many different ideas on how to improve it further. There are many avenues left to be explored in this ecosystem that is developing so rapidly, that it is hard to reach the point where you feel like you explored all the options and found the optimal solution.</p><p>Some of the ideas that would be exciting to try in the future:</p><ol><li><p>We put quite a few limitations regarding the code that our code agent generates, to make sure it works well enough: we don’t allow it to create helper files, to include npm dependencies, no TypeScript, no advanced Wasp features, … . <strong>We would love to lift the limitations</strong>, therefore allowing the creation of more complex and powerful apps.</p></li><li><p>Instead of our code agent doing everything in one shot, we could <strong>allow the user to interact with it</strong> after the first version of the app is generated: to provide additional prompts, for example, to fix something, to add some feature to the app, to do something differently, …. The hardest thing here would be figuring out which context to provide to the GPT at which moment and designing the experience appropriately, but I am certain it is doable, and it would take the Generator to the next level of usability.
Another option is to allow intervention in between initial generation steps → for example, after the plan is generated, to allow the user to adjust it by providing additional instructions to the GPT.</p></li><li><p>Find an open-source <strong>LLM that fits the purpose and fine-tune / pre-train it for our purpose</strong>. If we could teach it more about Wasp and the technologies we use, so we don’t have to include it in every prompt, we could save quite some context + have the LLM be more focused on the rules and guidelines we are specifying in the prompt. We could also host it ourselves and have more control over the costs and rate limits.</p></li><li><p>Take a <strong>different approach to the code agent: let it be more free</strong>. Instead of guiding it so carefully, we could teach it about all the different things it is allowed to ask for (ask for docs, ask for examples, ask to generate a certain piece of the app, ask to see a certain already generated piece of the app, …) and would let it guide itself more freely. It could constantly generate a plan, execute it, update the plan, and so on until it reaches the state of equilibrium. This approach potentially promises more flexibility and would likely be able to generate apps of greater complexity, but it also requires quite more tokens and a powerful LLM to drive it → I believe this approach will become more feasible as LLMs become more capable.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-us-️">Support us! ⭐️<a href="#support-us-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Support us! ⭐️" title="Direct link to Support us! ⭐️">​</a></h2><p>If you wish to express your support for what we are doing, consider giving us a <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star on Github</a>!

We saw GPT4 give better results than GPT3.5, but both still make mistakes, and GPT4 is also quite slow/expensive. Therefore we are quite excited about the further developments in the field of AI / LLMs, as they will directly affect the quality of the output for the tools like our Generator.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="next-features-wishlist">Next features wishlist<a href="#next-features-wishlist" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next features wishlist" title="Direct link to Next features wishlist">​</a></h3><ol><li>Get feedback on this initial experiment - both on the Generator and the Wasp as a framework itself: best place to leave us feedback is on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>.</li><li>Further improve code agent &amp; web app.</li><li>Release new version of <code>wasp</code> CLI that allows generating new Wasp project by providing short description via CLI.

Run our code agent via Wasp CLI or via Wasp vscode extension and have it generated for you, with initial logic already implemented.</li><li>As LLMs progress, try some alternative approaches, e.g. try fine-tuning an LLM with knowledge about Wasp, or give LLM more freedom while generating files and parts of the codebase.</li><li>Write a detailed blog post about how we implemented the Generator, which techniques we used, how we designed our prompts, what worked and what didn’t work, … .</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-us-️">Support us! ⭐️<a href="#support-us-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Support us! ⭐️" title="Direct link to Support us! ⭐️">​</a></h2><p>If you wish to express your support for what we are doing, consider giving us a <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">star on Github</a>!

As you might already know, Wasp has its own simple configuration language (<code>.wasp</code>) that acts as a glue between your React &amp; Node.js code.</p><p>Although it's a very simple, declarative language (you can think of it as a bit nicer/smarter JSON), and having it allows us to completely tailor the developer experience (aka get rid of boilerplate), it also means we have to provide our own tooling for it (syntax highlighting, auto completion, ...).</p><p>We started with syntax highlighting, then basic autocompletion and snippet support, but now we really took things to the next level! Writing Wasp code now is much closer to what we had in our mind when envisioning Wasp.</p><p>Without further ado, here's what's new:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-autocompletion-for-config-object-properties-auth-websocket-">✨ Autocompletion for config object properties (<code>auth</code>, <code>webSocket</code>, ...)<a href="#-autocompletion-for-config-object-properties-auth-websocket-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to -autocompletion-for-config-object-properties-auth-websocket-" title="Direct link to -autocompletion-for-config-object-properties-auth-websocket-">​</a></h2><p>Until now, Wasp offered autocompletion only for the top-level declarations such as <code>page</code> or <code>app</code>.

It keeps track of your notes and ideas, and uses them — along with tweets from trending-setting twitter users — to brainstorm new ideas and write tweet drafts for you! 💥</p><p>BTW, If you get stuck during the tutorial, or at any point just want to check out the full, final repo of the app we're building, here it is: <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/twitter-intern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/vincanger/twitter-intern</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-we-begin">Before We Begin<a href="#before-we-begin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before We Begin" title="Direct link to Before We Begin">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp = }</a> is the only open-source, completely serverful fullstack React/Node framework with a built in compiler that lets you build your app in a day and deploy with a single CLI command.</p><p>We’re working hard to help you build performant web apps as easily as possibly — including making these tutorials, which are released weekly!</p><p>We would be super grateful if you could help us out by starring our repo on GitHub: <a href="https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp</a> 🙏</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/d0Pkp9OMIBdC0/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6b39mgj7h8orvi0f4bjebceyx4gj0ih1xb6s05ujc&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media2.giphy.com/media/d0Pkp9OMIBdC0/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6b39mgj7h8orvi0f4bjebceyx4gj0ih1xb6s05ujc&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>…e<em>ven Ron would star <a href="https://www.github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp on GitHub</a></em> 🤩</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2><p>Twitter is a great marketing tool. It’s also a great way to explore ideas and refine your own. But it can be time-consuming and difficult to maintain a tweeting habit.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/WSrR5xkvljaFMe7UPo/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6g9o3drj567dbwyuo1c66x76eq8awc2r1oop8oypl&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media0.giphy.com/media/WSrR5xkvljaFMe7UPo/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6g9o3drj567dbwyuo1c66x76eq8awc2r1oop8oypl&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That’s why I decided to build my own personal twitter agent with <a href="https://js.langchain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a> on the basis of these assumptions:</p><p>🧠&nbsp;LLMs (like ChatGPT) aren’t the best writers, but they ARE great at brainstorming new ideas.</p><p>📊&nbsp;Certain twitter users drive the majority of discourse within certain niches, i.e. trend-setters influence what’s being discussed at the moment.</p><p>💡&nbsp;the Agent needs context in order to generate ideas relevant to YOU and your opinions, so it should have access to your notes, ideas, tweets, etc.</p><p>So instead of trying to build a fully autonomous agent that does the tweeting for you, I thought it would be better to build an agent that does the BRAINSTORMING for you, based on your favorite trend-setting twitter users as well as your own ideas.</p><p>Imagine it like an intern that does the grunt work, while you do the curating!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26DNdV3b6dqn1jzR6/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/26DNdV3b6dqn1jzR6/giphy.gif" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In order to accomplish this, we need to take advantage of a few hot AI tools:</p><ul><li>Embeddings and Vector Databases</li><li>LLMs (Large Language Models), such as ChatGPT</li><li>LangChain and sequential “chains” of LLM calls</li></ul><p>Embeddings and Vector Databases give us a powerful way to perform similarity searches on our own notes and ideas. </p><p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/what-is-similarity-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similarity search</a>, the simplest way to describe what similarity search is by comparing it to a normal google search. In a normal search, the phrase “a mouse eats cheese” will return results with a combination of <strong>those</strong> <strong>words</strong> <strong>only</strong>. But a vector-based similarity search, on the other hand, would return those words, as well as results with related words such as “dog”, “cat”, “bone”, and “fish”.</p><p>You can see why that’s so powerful, because if we have non-exact but related notes, our similarity search will still return them!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/xUySTD7evBn33BMq3K/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6273if8qfk83gbnv8uabc4occ0tnyzk0g0gfh0qg5&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" alt="https://media2.giphy.com/media/xUySTD7evBn33BMq3K/giphy.gif?cid=7941fdc6273if8qfk83gbnv8uabc4occ0tnyzk0g0gfh0qg5&amp;ep=v1_gifs_search&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For example, if our favorite trend-setting twitter user makes a post about the benefits of typescript, but we only have a note on “our favorite React hooks”, our similarity search would still likely return such a result. And that’s huge!</p><p>Once we get those notes, we can pass them to the ChatGPT completion API along with a prompt to generate more ideas. The result from this prompt will then be sent to another prompt with instructions to generate a draft tweet. We save these sweet results to our Postgres relational database.</p><p>This “chain” of prompting is essentially where the LangChain package gets its name 🙂</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The flow of information through the app" src="/assets/images/Untitled-a92a523b6dcedd69c52a2a565f63d3d7.png" width="1451" height="1562" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This approach will give us a wealth of new ideas and tweet drafts related to our favorite trend-setting twitter users’ tweets. We can look through these, edit and save our favorite ideas to our “notes” vector store, or maybe send off some tweets.</p><p>I’ve personally been using this app for a while now, and not only has it generated some great ideas, but it also helps to inspire new ones (even if some of the ideas it generates are “meh”), which is why I included an “Add Note” feature front and center to the nav bar</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="twitter-agent-add-note.png" src="/assets/images/twitter-agent-add-note-31c1c2840f9cd514c2fe9748e49f4abb.png" width="908" height="288" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ok.

href="https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg-boss</a>, a postgres extension, to queue and run tasks under the hood.</li><li>with <code>perform</code> we’re telling the job what function we want it to call: <code>generateNewIdeasWorker</code></li><li>just like actions and queries, we have to tell the job which entities we want to give it access to. In this case, we will need access to all of our entities.</li><li>the schedule allows us to pass some options to pg-boss so that we can make it a recurring task. In this case, I set it to run every 30 minutes, but you can set it to any interval you’d like (tip: change the comment and let github co-pilot write the cron for you). We also tell pg-boss to retry a failed job two times.</li></ul><p>Perfect. So now, our app will automatically scrape our favorite users’ tweets and generate new ideas for us every 30 minutes. This way, if we revisit the app after a few days, all the content will already be there and we won’t have to wait a long time for it to generate it for us. We also make sure we never miss out on generating ideas for older tweets.</p><p>But for that to happen, we have to define the function our job will call. To do this, create a new directory <code>worker</code> within the <code>server</code> folder, and within it a new file: <code>src/server/worker/generateNewIdeasWorker</code></p><div

For the every upcoming launch week, we ask ourselves how can we top the last one? How can we make building full-stack web apps easier, more enjoyable and get rid of even more boilerplate?</p><p>If this is the first time you're joining, check our previous launches:</p><ul><li><a href="/blog/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week">Launch Week 1: Beta</a></li><li><a href="/blog/2023/04/11/wasp-launch-week-two">Launch Week 2: Pizzazz</a></li></ul><p>Our first launch week was about making the promise of Wasp Alpha a reality, so you can build what you envisioned and deploy your app to production. The second launch made the whole experience much more polished, getting closer to the DX you'd expect from a mature web framework.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-magic">Why Magic?<a href="#why-magic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Magic?" title="Direct link to Why Magic?">​</a></h2><p>For this launch, with all the basics in place and <a href="/blog/2023/01/31/wasp-beta-launch-review">you having built thousands of apps with Wasp</a> (thank you!), <strong>we started pushing the boundaries of what web frameworks can do</strong>, utilising Wasp's unique DSL/compiler approach. This is still barely scratching the surface, but you'll be able to try it out yourself and get a taste of what the future of web development will look like.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Magic - LW3 in a nutshell" src="/img/lw3/magic.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">This launch week in a nutshell.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-coming-">What's coming 🐝<a href="#whats-coming-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's coming 🐝" title="Direct link to What's coming 🐝">​</a></h2><p>Every day next week, starting Monday, June 26, we'll highlight a major new feature in Wasp. We'll update this post daily as we reveal each feature, so make sure to keep coming back! Follow us on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/WaspLang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@wasplang</a>) to stay in the loop and also <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Discord</a> to join the community and get help as you're trying Wasp out.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="launch-party-">Launch party 🚀🎉<a href="#launch-party-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Launch party 🚀🎉" title="Direct link to Launch party 🚀🎉">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="launch event 2 - screenshot" src="/img/lw3/lw2-event-screenshot.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">A bit of the atmosphere from our last launch party</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>What would a launch be without a proper event and a party? A boring, heartless event, that's what!</p><p>That's why we'll get together to celebrate the launch, our community (you!) and all the hard work that's been put into this new, fresh edition of Wasp. You will also get to meet the team and hear first-hand from the makers about the latest features and plans for the future.</p><p>The party starts at <strong>9.30 am EDT / 3.30 pm CET</strong> - sign up <a href="https://discord.gg/p7TzVUn2?event=1121156549080002680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and make sure to mark yourself as "interested"!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="launch event - how to join" src="/img/lw3/lw-event-how-to-join.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>As per usual, there will be memes, swag and lots of interesting dev discussions!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="auto-crud--monday-the-future-is-now-">Auto CRUD | Monday: The future is now 🛸<a href="#auto-crud--monday-the-future-is-now-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Auto CRUD | Monday: The future is now 🛸" title="Direct link to Auto CRUD | Monday: The future is now 🛸">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="The future is now" src="/img/lw3/future-is-now.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>We'll immediately kick things off with a bang! What's the one thing that all developers universally agree is something they'd like to do less of? Writing boilerplate CRUD logic, of course! Yet, it's 2023 and the best we managed to do is get an AI write it half-correctly for us and we still have to maintain it.</p><p>That's what we are coming after - is it possible to avoid writing (or generating) CRUD code in the first place? How far can we take it and what's then even left for your to code?

And there might be cake.</p><p>To wrap the week up, we'll also start another hackathon, but this time in a bit different format. Since the best way to learn something is to teach it to others, we'll focus on tutorials this time!

Looking back, this probably wasn't the best approach because it didn't give people much time to prepare. This time around, we announced the hackathon a week in advance, giving people a bit more time to prepare their projects. </p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Wasp Betathon Homepage" src="/img/hackathon2/hackathon-2-homepage.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Our dedicated hackathon landing page w/ intro video &amp; countdown timer</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>And just like last time, we kept the Hackathon rules simple: no categories, no constraints, just 10 days to create any fullstack web app using Wasp, alone or in a team of up to 4 people.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Keyboard" src="/img/betathon/keyboard.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>We may be a bit unoriginal here, but we also decided to offer the same grand prize as the Betathon: a Wasp-colored mechanical keyboard. On top of that, runner-ups also got some project-related prizes, as well as Wasp beanies, shirts, and other swag. Of course, we also spotlight the winner’s on our social media accounts.</p><p>Something new we did this time was hold a post-hackathon presentation event on Discord, thanks to a suggestion made by <a href="https://twitter.com/maksim36ua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a>, one of our most dedicated contributers. We gave each team a chance to present their projects and talk a bit about their experience. The turnout was great, with almost all the teams participating, and it helped us to get to know the faces behind the apps. Not only was this a great way to connect more with our community, but it also gave us some insight into where are users are coming from, what they're interested in, and what they're looking for in Wasp. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promotion">Promotion<a href="#promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promotion" title="Direct link to Promotion">​</a></h2><p>As of late, we've made an effort to promote exemplary apps built with Wasp, as well as create some of our own. This has been a great way to show off Wasp's capabilities, and has resulted in a noticeable increase in interest and traffic. Therefore, for the Hackathon, we let the organic interest in Wasp be the driver for the Hackathon, as we didn't do much promotion outside of our own channels, nor did we partner with any other sponsors this time. We simply announced the Hackathon and directed people to our <a href="https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacakthon homepage</a> we created.</p><p>The hackathon page is nice to have as a central spot for all the rules and relevant info. We also added a fun intro video using AI-generated narration of a possibly well-known actor 😎. Overall, the effort put into the homepage gives participants the feeling that they’re entering into a serious contest and committing to something of substance, while the light-heartedness of the promotion material lets them know that it's more about fun than serious prizes. But even in the abscence of big winnings, the quality of the submissions were suprisingly high. Intrinsic motivation, ftw! 🤩</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Hackathon Wasp app repo" src="/img/betathon/github.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Wanna host your own Hackathon? Use our template app!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Again, just like we did previously, we wrote the Hackathon Homepage with Wasp, and put the <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/examples/hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code up on our GitHub</a>. We thought it might inspire people to build with Wasp, using it as a guide while creating their own projects for the hackathon, plus it could be used by others in the future if they want to host their own hackathon. 💻</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-response-20">The Response 2.0<a href="#the-response-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Response 2.0" title="Direct link to The Response 2.0">​</a></h3><p>We were really pleased to see the response to the Hackathon surpass our expectations, yet again. The number, quality, and creativity of the submissions were even better than the Betathon. We also had a lot of fun interacting with the participants, and we're looking forward to doing it again soon.</p><p>It's reaffirming to see Wasp grow along with our community, as they build more and more cool stuff with it. Events like this give us a morale and confidence boost as it confirms that we're building something the community wants. </p><p><strong>Thanks so much again to the participants for their hard work and contributions. We're grateful and happy to have you along for the ride! 🐝🚀</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

I had already wanted to create a SaaS app that could help manage the process of applying to numerous jobs, and the prospect of adding GPT into the mix made it even more interesting. So with API access and a bit of free time, I decided to give it a shot.</p><p>I threw together a simple version of the app in about 3-4 days and <a href="https://coverlettergpt.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoverLetterGPT</a> was born, a SaaS app that uses GPT-3.5-turbo to generate, revise, and manage cover letters for you based on your skills and the specific job descriptions. </p><p>Even though I did think it had potential as a SaaS app, I was approaching it mostly as a way to learn how to build one for the first time. And after seeing so many people "building in public" and sharing their progress, I thought it would be fun to try it out myself.</p><div style="margin-bottom:1rem"><a href="https://twitter.com/hot_town/status/1633873684573323265?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/coverlettergpt.png" alt="Hey peeps. Check out http://coverlettergpt.xyz. You can try it out now and create your own cover letters for free (no Payment/API key). I'm working on A LOT more features. Stay Tuned!" class="img_ev3q"></a></div><p>So I started sharing my progress on Twitter, Reddit, and Indie Hackers. I made my first post about it on March 9th, and because I was just experimenting and trying my hand at a SaaS app for the first time, I also <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/coverlettergpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-sourced the app</a> to share the code and what I was learning with others. This led to a lot of interest and great feedback, and I ended up getting featured in the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/whats-new-don-t-build-things-no-one-wants-833ee752ba?utm_source=indie-hackers-emails&amp;utm_campaign=ih-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indiehackers newsletter</a>, which led to even more interest.</p><p>Within the first month, I got over 1,000 sign-ups along with my first paying customers. Pretty surprising, to say the least!</p><p>So to continue in the spirit of curiosity, learning, and just "wingin' it," I decided to make a code walkthrough video that explains how I built the app, the tools I used to build it, and a little bit about how I marketed the app without spending any money. </p><p>As an extra bonus, I also give a quick introduction to the <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/SaaS-Template-GPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free SaaS template</a> I created for building your own SaaS app, with or without GPT, on the PERN stack (PostgreSQL/Prisma, Express, React, NodeJS).</p><p>My hope is that others will learn something from my experience, and that it could inspire them to try out new technologies and build that app idea they've had in mind (and if they do, they should make sure to share it with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hot_town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hot_town</a> -- I'd love to see it!)</p><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a full-stack framework, Wasp doesn’t care “just” about frontend and backend, but it also covers the database!</p><p>It does this by allowing you to define Prisma data models in a Wasp file, connecting them to the relevant Wasp Operations, warning you if you need to do database migrations, deploying the database for you (if you choose so), … .</p><p>Since Wasp knows so much about your database, that puts us in a good position to keep finding ways to improve the developer experience regarding dealing with the database. For Wasp v0.10, we focused on:</p><ol><li>Wasp running the dev database for you with no config needed → <strong>Fully Managed Dev Database</strong> 🚀</li><li>Wasp helping you to initialize the database with some data → <strong>Db Seeding</strong> 🌱</li></ol><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="strong wasp database" src="/img/db-start-and-seed/wasp-db-improvements.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Wasp now has `wasp start db` and `wasp db seed`!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fully-managed-dev-database-">Fully Managed Dev Database 🚀<a href="#fully-managed-dev-database-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fully Managed Dev Database 🚀" title="Direct link to Fully Managed Dev Database 🚀">​</a></h2><p>You might have asked yourself:</p><blockquote><p>If Wasp already knows so much about my database, why do I need to bother running it on my own!?</p></blockquote><p>Ok, when you start a new Wasp project it is easy because you are using an SQLite database, but once you switch to Postgres, it falls onto you to take care of it: run it, provide its URL to Wasp via env var, handle multiple databases if you have multiple Wasp apps, … .</p><p>This can get tedious quickly, especially if you are visiting your Wasp project that you haven’t worked on for a bit and need to figure out again how to run the db, or you need to check out somebody else’s Wasp project and don’t have it all set up yet. It is something most of us are used to, especially with other frameworks, but still, we can do better at Wasp!</p><p>This is where <code>wasp start db</code> comes in!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="wasp start db running in terminal" src="/img/db-start-and-seed/wasp-start-db-terminal.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">wasp start db in action, running a posgtres dev db for you</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, all you need to do to run the development database, is run <code>wasp start db</code>, and Wasp will run it for you and will know how to connect to it during development.</p><p>No env var setting, no remembering how to run the db. The only requirement is that you have <code>Docker</code> installed on your machine. Data from your database will be persisted on the disk between the runs, and each Wasp app will have its own database assigned. </p><p>Btw, you can still use a custom database that you ran on your own if you want, the same way it was done before in Wasp: by setting env var <code>DATABASE_URL</code>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="database-seeding-">Database seeding 🌱<a href="#database-seeding-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database seeding 🌱" title="Direct link to Database seeding 🌱">​</a></h2><p><strong>Database seeding</strong>&nbsp;is a term for populating the database with some initial data.</p><p>Seeding is most commonly used for two following scenarios:</p><ol><li>To put the development database into a state convenient for testing / playing with it.</li><li>To initialize the dev/staging/prod database with some essential data needed for it to be useful, for example, default currencies in a Currency table.</li></ol><p>Wasp so far had no direct support for seeding, so you had to either come up with your own solution (e.g. script that connects to the db and executes some queries), or massage data manually via Prisma Studio (<code>wasp db studio</code>).</p><p>There is one big drawback to both of the approaches I mentioned above though: there is no easy way to reuse logic that you have already implemented in your Wasp app, especially Actions (e.g. <code>createTask</code>)! This is pretty bad, as it makes your seeding logic brittle.</p><p>This is where <code>wasp db seed</code> comes in! Now, Wasp allows you to write a JS/TS function, import any server logic (including Actions) into it as you wish, and then seed the database with it.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we go again! After three months of building and talking to our community about what features they'd like to see next, we're proud to kick off our second Launch Week. It stars tomorrow, and you can <a href="https://discord.gg/PX6KczVz?event=1093188663912964136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up for the launch event here</a>!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Launch Week 2 is coming" src="/img/lw2/lw2-banner.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Wasp Beta introduced a lot of core features that enabled developers to a build full-fledged SaaS-es. Since then, our community grew rapidly and we watched you deploy numerous apps and some of you even <a href="/blog/2022/11/26/erlis-amicus-usecase">making their startups and earning their first revenue on top of Wasp</a>!</p><p>Seeing that all the essential building blocks are now in place, <strong>our next goal became to make Wasp really easy (and fun) to use</strong>. We've had a bunch of ideas on everything we'd like to improve with DX for a while, and now finally came the right time to do it.</p><p>Nonetheless, the theme and sentiment of this launch week is best captured by an ancient term that poets used to describe some of the most beautiful and marvelous wonders of the world (e.g. pyramids, or the hanging gardens of Babylon): <strong>pizzazz</strong> 🍕.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wednesday-apr-12---launch-event---pizzazz-opener-auth-ui-">Wednesday, Apr 12 - Launch event 🚀 + Pizzazz opener: Auth UI 💅<a href="#wednesday-apr-12---launch-event---pizzazz-opener-auth-ui-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wednesday, Apr 12 - Launch event 🚀 + Pizzazz opener: Auth UI 💅" title="Direct link to Wednesday, Apr 12 - Launch event 🚀 + Pizzazz opener: Auth UI 💅">​</a></h2><p>Wasp's easy auth has been by a long shot one of the most popular features in the community. We decided to take it one step further - <strong>Wasp now offers beautifully designed, pre-made auth components</strong> that you can simply plug into your app and immediately get that razzle dazzle on!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Auth UI Demo" src="/img/lw2/auth-ui-demo.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">On your localhost, tomorrow</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>We'll present this and much more at our Kick-off event, starting tomorrow <strong>on our Discord at 10 am EDT / 4 pm CET</strong> - sign up <a href="https://discord.gg/PX6KczVz?event=1093188663912964136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and make sure to mark yourself as interested!</p><p>Join us to meet the team and to be the first to get a sneak peek into the latest features! We'll follow up with a casual AMA session, showcase selected community projects and discuss all together about what we'd like to see in Wasp next.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="LW2 launch party instructions" src="/img/lw2/discord-event-info.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>P.S. : The word is out that there will be a raffle and that the most lucky one(s) will win some cool Wasp swag!

Given that Wasp is a fully managed full-stack framework that "understands" all parts of your dev process, we were in unique position to offer this functionality.</p><p>P.S. - you haven't been connecting to the prod database all along during development, have you?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="saturday-apr-15---more-launch-goodness-custom-api-routes--email-sending-️">Saturday, Apr 15 - More launch goodness: Custom API routes + Email sending ✉️<a href="#saturday-apr-15---more-launch-goodness-custom-api-routes--email-sending-️" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Saturday, Apr 15 - More launch goodness: Custom API routes + Email sending ✉️" title="Direct link to Saturday, Apr 15 - More launch goodness: Custom API routes + Email sending ✉️">​</a></h2><p>It's Saturday, so you get two features for the price of one!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-custom-api-routes">Add custom API routes<a href="#add-custom-api-routes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add custom API routes" title="Direct link to Add custom API routes">​</a></h3><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Custom API routes" src="/img/lw2/custom-api-route.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Adding a custom route handler at /foo/bar endpoint</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Although for typical CRUD you don't have to define an API since Wasp offers a typesafe RPC layer via <a href="/docs/data-model/operations/overview">operations</a>, sometimes you need extra flexibility (e.g. for implementing webhooks).

            <description><![CDATA[<ImgWithCaption]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Where is Vite" src="/img/new-react-docs/evan-you-no-vite.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>React just released their new docs at <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://react.dev/</a>. While it looks great and packs a lot of improvements, one section that caught the community’s attention is “<a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Start a New React Project</a>”. The strongly recommended way to start a new React project is to use a framework such as Next.js, while the traditional route of using bundlers like Vite or CRA is fairly strongly discouraged.</p><p>Next.js is a great framework, and its rise in popularity is due in a large part to the return of SEO optimization via Server-Side-Rendering (SSR) within the collective developer conscience. And it definitely does make sense to use a framework that provides SSR for static sites and pages that rely on SEO.</p><p>But what about typical Single Page Apps (SPAs)? Dashboard-like tools that live behind the auth (and don’t need SEO at all), and for which React was originally designed, still very much exist.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-new-react-docs---use-a-framework-unless-your-app-has-unusual-constraints">The new React docs - use a framework unless your app has “unusual” constraints<a href="#the-new-react-docs---use-a-framework-unless-your-app-has-unusual-constraints" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The new React docs - use a framework unless your app has “unusual” constraints" title="Direct link to The new React docs - use a framework unless your app has “unusual” constraints">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="react new project docs" src="/img/new-react-docs/react-new-project.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>The new docs make a pretty strong claim for using a framework when starting a new React project. Even if you read through the “Can I use React without a framework” section (hidden behind a collapsed toggle by default), you have to go through a wall of text convincing you why not using a framework is a bad idea, mainly due to the lack of SSR. Only then, in the end, comes the piece mentioning other options, such as Vite and Parcel:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="use framework unless you app has unusual constraints" src="/img/new-react-docs/your-app-unusual.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Even then, first you’ll have to admit your app has unusual constraints (and no examples were given of what that could be) before you’re actually “allowed” not to use a framework. It feels very much like you’re doing it in spite of all the warnings and that there actually isn’t a case where you should do it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-spas-still-matter">Why SPAs (still) matter<a href="#why-spas-still-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why SPAs (still) matter" title="Direct link to Why SPAs (still) matter">​</a></h2><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="SPAs still have their place" src="/img/new-react-docs/spas-have-place.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>SSR/SSG has been getting a lot of attention lately and has been a flagship feature of most new frameworks built on top of React. And rightly so - it has solved a major issue of using React for static &amp; SEO-facing sites where time to first content (FCP) is crucial.</p><p>On the other hand, the use case where React, Angular, and other UI frameworks initially shined were dashboard apps (e.g., project management systems, CRMs, …) - it allowed for a radically better UX, which resembled that of desktop apps.</p><p>Although interactive content-rich apps (blogging platforms, marketplaces, social platforms) are today a typical poster child demo app for frameworks, dashboard-like apps still very much exist, and there are more of them than ever. Thousands of companies are building their internal tools daily, just like new SaaS-es pop up every day.</p><p>SEO is largely irrelevant for them since everything is happening behind the auth layer, where everything is centered around workflows, not content. SSR might even be counter-productive since it puts more pressure on your servers instead of distributing the rendering load across the clients.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-then-would-you-develop-spas">How then would you develop SPAs?<a href="#how-then-would-you-develop-spas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How then would you develop SPAs?" title="Direct link to How then would you develop SPAs?">​</a></h2><p>Traditionally, React was only a UI library in your stack of choice. You would use CRA (or Vite nowadays) as a bundler/starter for your React project. Then you’d probably add a routing library (e.g., react-router) and maybe a state management library (e.g., Redux, or react-query), and you’d already be set pretty well. You would develop your backend in whatever you choose - Node.js/Express, Rails, or anything else.</p><p>There are also new frameworks emerging that focus on this particular use case (e.g., <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedwoodJS</a> and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> (disclaimer: this is us!)) whose flagship feature is not SSR, but rather the abstraction of API and CRUD on data models, and getting full-stack functionality from UI to the database, with extra features such as easy authentication and deployment out of the box.</p><p>With a “go for Next or you are unusual” and “you need SSR” message, React is making a strong signal against other solutions that don’t emphasize SSR as their main feature.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-whats-the-big-deal-nobody-forces-you-to-use-ssr-in-nextremix">So what’s the big deal? Nobody forces you to use SSR in Next/Remix<a href="#so-whats-the-big-deal-nobody-forces-you-to-use-ssr-in-nextremix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So what’s the big deal? Nobody forces you to use SSR in Next/Remix" title="Direct link to So what’s the big deal? Nobody forces you to use SSR in Next/Remix">​</a></h2><p>That’s correct, but also it’s true that a buy-in into a whole framework is a much bigger step than just opting for a UI library. Frameworks are (more) opinionated and come with many decisions (code structure, architecture, deployment) made upfront for you. Which is great and that’s why they are valuable and why we’ll keep using them.</p><p>But, both sides of the story should be presented, and the final call should be left to the developer. React is too useful, valuable, and popular a tool and community to allow itself to skip this step.</p><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="/#signup">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

I will share some code snippets to show what was required to build the app with both Wasp and Supabase.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Phrase Tutor’s front-end" src="/img/building-a-full-stack-app-supabase-vs-wasp/phrase_tutor.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Phrase Tutor’s front-end</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>As a senior full-stack developer with experience in building many side-projects, I prefer a quick development cycle. I enjoy turning ideas into POCs in just a few days or even hours.</p><p>We will examine how each technology can help when building a full-stack app and where Wasp and Supabase excel.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-wanted-to-learn-italian-fast">I wanted to learn Italian fast<a href="#i-wanted-to-learn-italian-fast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I wanted to learn Italian fast" title="Direct link to I wanted to learn Italian fast">​</a></h3><p>Whenever I travel abroad, I enjoy imagining what it would be like to live in that place. For instance, I usually don't like taking crowded public transportation, but for some reason, it brings me joy when I do it in a foreign country. It's all about the feeling that I'm living there. One of the most important things for me to fully experience the culture is to learn the language or, at the very least, be able to not speak English all the time.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Pretending to be Italian" src="/img/building-a-full-stack-app-supabase-vs-wasp/italian.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Pretending to be Italian</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>My girlfriend and I were planning a trip to Italy, and I wanted to learn some Italian. I thought about what would be the easiest way to learn as much as possible with the least amount of effort. I decided that learning the top 100 Italian phrases would be a good start. I had a week to do it, and learning 100 phrases seemed doable if I practiced every day.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-learning-method">The learning method<a href="#the-learning-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The learning method" title="Direct link to The learning method">​</a></h3><p>In high school, I had a system for learning historical facts and dates quickly called "focusing on things you don’t know".</p><p>Here's how it works:</p><ol><li>Gather a pool of facts you want to learn (e.g. "When did WWI start?" - "1914").</li><li>Ask yourself each question in the pool.</li><li>If you know the answer, remove the fact from the pool.</li><li>If you don't know the answer, keep it in the pool.</li><li>Repeat with the smaller pool until there are no more facts left.</li></ol><p>I made a small app for this and shared it with my classmates, but it didn't go further than that.</p><p>Now, I want to use the same method to learn Italian phrases for my trip. So, as a better developer now, I'll make a proper app and host it somewhere 🙂</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-the-phrase-tutor-app">Building the Phrase Tutor app<a href="#building-the-phrase-tutor-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building the Phrase Tutor app" title="Direct link to Building the Phrase Tutor app">​</a></h2><p>We will create an app that follows the method described above. The app will show you a phrase and you can tell it if you know the translation or not by selecting "I knew it" or "I didn't know it".</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="How the learning in the app should work" src="/img/building-a-full-stack-app-supabase-vs-wasp/phrases.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">How the learning in the app should work</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>The app will keep track of your answers and suggest which phrases you should learn next 🕵️</p><p>I’ve built the app twice: first with Supabase and then with Wasp. Supabase is a well-rounded open-source Backend as a Service (BaaS) product that adds superpowers to your front-end apps. On the other hand, Wasp is an open-source framework for building full-stack apps that helps to keep the boilerplate low. Let’s see how they compare.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="initial-supabase-version">Initial Supabase version<a href="#initial-supabase-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Initial Supabase version" title="Direct link to Initial Supabase version">​</a></h3><p>When I made the initial version, I worked heavily with Vue.js, which I used to create the first version of the Phrase Tutor app. I started by collecting some phrases. I searched on Google for "best Italian phrases to learn" and came across an article titled "100 Italian phrases to learn." (After extracting the phrases from the HTML, I found out that there were only 96 phrases, but that was still good enough for me.)</p><p>The initial app contained the phrases in a <a href="https://github.com/infomiho/phrase-tutor-supabase/blob/master/src/phrases/italian.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON file</a> that the frontend loaded. It was completely static, but it worked.</p><div class="language-json codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-json codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"id"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"group"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"general"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"translations"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"en"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"Yes"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        </span><span class="token property" style="color:#36acaa">"it"</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"Si"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>I put it on Cloudflare Pages and it went live.</p><p>I showed it to my girlfriend, but she didn't like some of the phrases I used.

I'm really happy to work on a technology that solves a problem I care about: when I do side-projects, I dislike writing the same dull parts every time from scratch. I copy and paste from my previous side projects, but eventually, the code snippets become old and outdated.</p><p>Naturally, I wanted to test out Wasp by rewriting one of my side projects. I decided to see how Wasp could work with the Phrase Tutor project.</p><p>Wasp works by having an easy-to-understand config file called <code>main.wasp</code> which coordinates your pieces of client and server functionalities. Its main purpose is to keep you productive and focused on writing interesting bits. It feels pretty much like using a web framework that covers your whole app.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Phrase Tutor built with Wasp" src="/img/building-a-full-stack-app-supabase-vs-wasp/wasp.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Phrase Tutor built with Wasp</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Let's begin by creating the data models. Wasp uses Prisma under the hood to communicate with your database, which makes it easy to manage your database without worrying about the details. This is just one of the many choices the framework made for me, and I appreciate the feeling of using a setup that works.</p><p>I had to first declare all of the entities I needed with Prisma PSL in the Wasp config file.</p><div class="language-wasp codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre

It's good to think about different ways to do things and their pros and cons.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Supabase</th><th>Wasp</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Getting data from the API</td><td>Use the Supabase JS SDK to query database tables</td><td>Declare query in Wasp config and use Prisma JS SDK to implement it</td></tr><tr><td>Custom business logic</td><td>Writing custom PostgreSQL procedures or by writing edge functions</td><td>Declare actions in the Wasp file and write server-side JS</td></tr><tr><td>Defining the database schema</td><td>Visual editor or by CREATE TABLE query</td><td>By code - edit Prisma schema and commit changes</td></tr><tr><td>Auth</td><td>Enable in UI</td><td>Enable it in the Wasp file</td></tr><tr><td>Deployment</td><td>Supabase managed instance or self-host it</td><td>Deploy anywhere, support for <a href="https://fly.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fly.io</a> one line deployment</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With Supabase, I liked how familiar the SDK felt and their UI made it easy to configure parts of my backend. I didn’t need to think about deploying Supabase since I used their hosted version, but it did get paused after 1 week of inactivity on the free tier.</p><p>On the other hand, Wasp felt like the glue for my React + Express.js + Prisma app and I needed to write more code to get things done. It felt more explicit because I wrote code closer to what I would normally write. I deployed it to <a href="https://fly.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly.io</a> with the Wasp command <code>wasp deploy fly launch</code> and it’s now live on <a href="https://phrasetutor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://phrasetutor.com</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="its-all-about-the-use-case">It's all about the use case<a href="#its-all-about-the-use-case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to It's all about the use case" title="Direct link to It's all about the use case">​</a></h3><p>Choosing the right solution for your needs can be difficult. That's why it's important to try out different options and see how they work for you. In this case, I compared two options: Supabase and Wasp.</p><p>Supabase is a great choice if you want a well-rounded open-source BaaS product that adds superpowers to your front-end apps. It provides a lot of free stuff, such as a PostgreSQL database and social authentication, which can make development easier and faster. It also has a nice SDK and UI that the end user can use to easily define their app's configuration.</p><p>Wasp is an open-source framework for building full-stack apps that helps out with keeping the boilerplate low. It is a bit more explicit about some things, such as defining your auth entities, but that can be a plus when you have more advanced use cases. By using Wasp as the glue for your full-stack application, you can have the best of both worlds: a development and production setup that works out of the box while still allowing you to develop your app any way you like.</p><p>In the case of Phrase Tutor, I liked working with both Supabase and Wasp. I did, however, get a different feeling from working with the two technologies. With Supabase I felt like my front-end app got instant superpowers and it now has a database and login, which was nice considering the effort I had to put in. But now I had a black-box dependency that I needed to build around.</p><p>When I used Wasp to rebuild Phrase Tutor, it felt different because it was a full-stack app. I had more control over the application code, so I could change it and evolve it as I wanted. I felt like I had built an app that could grow in any direction. Although I had to write more code, it felt like a good trade-off for future needs.</p><p>To decide which option is best for you, I would suggest trying both and seeing how you feel. It is easy to set up both tools and see if they make sense for you.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Grazie for reading 🙃" src="/img/building-a-full-stack-app-supabase-vs-wasp/thank_you.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Grazie for reading 🙃</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>If you try out the Phrase Tutor app, please let me know what you think. You can reach me on Twitter. I'm always looking for ways to make it better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="hard truths for junior devs" src="/img/hard-truths-junior-devs.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Ok, I have to admit, these aren’t really Truths, but rather some opinions I’ve formed over my journey switching careers from Educator to Developer.</p><p>It’s well known at this point that software — especially web — development is a viable option for someone looking for a new career without going the traditional education route. Due to this, and the fact that salaries tend to be very good, I think a portion of people making the switch might be doing it for the wrong reasons. </p><p>And once you get into that career, as a Junior it can often be difficult to know what you should be doing to advance your career. There are a ton of opinions out there (including mine) and juniors tend to develop a lot of misconceptions, as my colleague and I discussed in our recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/112im2m/senior_devs_what_are_the_most_damaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post</a> and <a href="/blog/2023/02/21/junior-developer-misconceptions">follow-up video</a>.</p><p>So, I put together this list of things you should consider when starting out a career in tech: </p><ol><li><p>👎 <strong>If you’re doing it solely for the money, you’re not gonna make it.</strong> True, you don’t need a degree or anyone’s permission to advance in this career, but you need ambition and mental stamina. A genuine interest is needed to maintain them. </p></li><li><p>😎&nbsp;<strong>You don’t have to follow the trends. Follow what interests you.</strong> Like I said before, you need mental stamina in this field of work. Following your interests will keep you engaged and help avoid burnout.</p></li><li><p>👩‍💻&nbsp;<strong>You don’t need to know a piece of tech inside and out,</strong> contrary to what some devs might want you to believe. The truth is, you are always learning, and there will always be gaps in your knowledge. Your confidence in being able to fill those gaps is what matters.</p></li><li><p>🧱&nbsp;<strong>Start building, ASAP.</strong> Find a problem that interests you and build the solution yourself. Contribute to Open-Source projects that you use. A portfolio of unique work speaks volumes about your abilities. Plus, there’s no better teacher than experience. </p></li><li><p>😱&nbsp;<strong>Be fearless and seek feedback.</strong> Put your work out there and be ready to have it criticized. If you can stomach it, you’ll come out the other side a much better developer. </p></li><li><p>🧐&nbsp;<strong>You should have a firm understanding of what you’re doing.</strong> Don’t copy-paste someone else’s answer (or GPT’s) to your problem and call it a day. Question why things work, and figure it out for yourself.</p></li><li><p>🏋️‍♀️&nbsp;<strong>You have to do the grunt work, unfortunately. Don’t expect high salaries from the beginning.</strong> And you’ll probably want to improve your portfolio by working on side projects in your free time, or you might stay a junior dev for longer than you wish. </p></li><li><p>🧗‍♂️&nbsp;<strong>Challenge yourself. Don’t let yourself get too comfortable.</strong> If you do, you won’t improve. Offer to take new, difficult, and daunting tasks at work or with your personal projects. You’ll be surprised what you can achieve. </p></li><li><p>💰&nbsp;<strong>You don’t have to pay for boot camps or courses.</strong> In fact, you’re better off tackling problems on your own and only asking for help if you’re truly stuck. There’s a wealth of free resources out there, and when you’re on the job, these might be the only things to assist you.</p></li><li><p>🗣&nbsp;<strong>Programming is definitely not the only skill you’ll need.</strong> Being respectful, communicative, conscientious, ambitious, and humble will put you in a different league and make you a valuable asset in any tech team. </p></li></ol><p>TIP: <em>Looking for some inspiration?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br><blockquote><p><em>High code quality only indirectly affects users. The main purpose is to keep development velocity high which benefits all stakeholders</em>
<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- --> — <strong>zoechi</strong></p></blockquote><br><p>We recently asked the web dev community on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/112im2m/senior_devs_what_are_the_most_damaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit.com</a> what the most common misconceptions are amongst junior developers, and we got a ton of great responses -- more than 270 to be exact.</p><p>Because there was so much to discuss, Matija and I decided to summarize the replies and give our own opinions in a longer-form YouTube video, which you can watch below. </p><p><em>You can also continue reading further for a summary of the main concepts.</em></p><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eermNn9VhOA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><p></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-most-common-themes">The Most Common Themes<a href="#the-most-common-themes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Most Common Themes" title="Direct link to The Most Common Themes">​</a></h2><p>Among the responses were lots of great, specific examples, but we noticed a lot of common themes within them:</p><ul><li><strong>Code Quality</strong></li><li><strong>Managing Time &amp; Expectations</strong></li><li><strong>Effective Communication &amp; Teamwork</strong></li></ul><p>These seemed to be the topics senior devs had the most to say about. And it makes sense -- these are the things that, when you get to the core of the issues, can make or break almost <em>any</em> career. </p><p>It was also interesting to see that the top replies were issues that encompassed all of these themes. For example, take the top-voted reply:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Clean it up later" src="/img/junior-misconceptions/come-back-later.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">The most common misconception is that you're going to come back and clean that up later.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-quality--then-velocity">First Quality &amp; Then Velocity<a href="#first-quality--then-velocity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First Quality &amp; Then Velocity" title="Direct link to First Quality &amp; Then Velocity">​</a></h2><p>The top reply above touches on all three of the common themes we outlined, because within it is a message about quality -- about doing things correctly. And whenever you speak about quality, there is an inherent assumption that it takes longer, so we're also talking about time management. And, if you're a part of a team, you can't work effectively without good communication and teamwork.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the "quality" debate there were effectively two camps, with those who thought quality code was about: </p><ol><li>writing clean, readable code, that's easy to maintain </li><li>writing code that gets shipped on time and works.</li></ol><p>The balance between meeting deadlines, shipping features, and writing the best possible code is obviously a tricky one to get right. Some people had the opinion that business realities trump clean code patterns in the dash to meet deadlines and keep clients happy, while others thought that clean, quality code should be the priority, and that by making it a priority you can actually increase long-term velocity, even if short-term deadlines aren't met.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="You don't have to touch all the code you see" src="/img/junior-misconceptions/touch-all-code.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>This discussion can distract from Junior developers priorities though, which are to grow and improve as a developer, not lead the team to success. Therefore, it's probably best for Junior devs to focus on quality first, and then improve their speed of delivery second.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stay-humble--manage-expectations">Stay Humble &amp; Manage Expectations<a href="#stay-humble--manage-expectations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stay Humble &amp; Manage Expectations" title="Direct link to Stay Humble &amp; Manage Expectations">​</a></h2><p>As a Junior developer, it's not expected that you're going to get everything right the first time. There is an assumption that you will learn the best practices over time, and along the way you might produce inconsistent work, make mistakes, or even possibly break some things along the way.</p><p>But that's okay. </p><p>It's part of the process. It's expected. And it's important to remember that this is not a reflection of your value or worth as an engineer or individual. </p><p>In the replies, there were also many developers who recognized another developer's desire "to fix things later" as a way to brush off criticism towards their work. They generally viewed this as a bad habit to get into, as it is often one that plagues developers even as they gain more experience. "Code reviews are not personal", and being able to take criticism graciously is an important skill to develop. After all, seniors are there to guide you towards making better decisions based on their own experiences. And juniors are there to learn.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="The senior dev doesn't know everything" src="/img/junior-misconceptions/senior-knows-all.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>But how often should you seek a Senior's advice? Should you do what they said, or what some dude told you <em>is the only way to do x</em> on YouTube or in some blogpost ;) ? </p><p>Should you ask for help every time you get stuck, or should you compromise your sanity and struggle alone for days?</p><p>Well, it depends on who you ask. But most of the replies made it clear that:</p><ol><li>You should try it out yourself first.</li><li>Use the resources available to you (Google, Stack Overflow, GPT) to try and figure it out.</li><li>Ask for help once you considerably slow down on making any progress.</li><li>If you have a possible solution and it differs from the senior dev's suggestion, that doesn't mean it's wrong -- there can sometimes be many possible ways to achieve the same goal!</li></ol><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Bothering seniors with questions" src="/img/junior-misconceptions/bothering-questions.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="be-flexibile--open-to-change">Be Flexibile &amp; Open to Change<a href="#be-flexibile--open-to-change" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Be Flexibile &amp; Open to Change" title="Direct link to Be Flexibile &amp; Open to Change">​</a></h2><p>Nothing changes faster than the world of technology. As a developer, you need to constantly be learning and adapting to new technologies and trends. If you don't like change, well then being a software developer probably isn't the right career for you.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Everything takes longer than you think" src="/img/junior-misconceptions/everything-takes-longer.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>On top of things changing constantly, it's the kind of job that challenges your assumptions. What you think might be the best solution turns out to be incompatible with your team's desired goals or end product, and you're forced to use a "sub-optimal" solution instead. Why? Because it's the best way to
get the job done given your team's constraints. <em>"Sorry, pal, but we can't use your favorite framework on this one."</em></p><p>The developers who stay flexible and open-minded are often at an advantage here. They're the ones that are less dogmatic about a particular technology or approach, and are more willing to adapt to the situation at hand. They're typically the ones that progress faster than their peers, and they're the ones that get the job done well.</p><hr><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="/#signup">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br><blockquote><p><em>I guess it was less me having an idea and validating it, and more a valid idea coming to me and biting me in the ass, and me thinking ‘oh hey…’</em>
<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- --> — <strong>Erlis Kllogjri</strong></p></blockquote><br><p>Erlis Kllogjri, a computer engineer and the creator of <a href="https://amicus.work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amicus.work</a>, went from idea to paying customers in just one week 🤯! In this interview, he tells how sometimes the best ideas come looking for you, and how moving quickly can help you stay inspired, motivated, and pull in your first satisfied customers.</p><br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:500px" alt="Amicus Homepage" src="/img/amicus-usecase/amicus-homepage.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-we-begin-with-the-unlikely-origin-story-of-amicuswork-can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-what-it-is">Before we begin with the unlikely origin story of Amicus.work, can you tell us a bit about what it is?<a href="#before-we-begin-with-the-unlikely-origin-story-of-amicuswork-can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-what-it-is" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before we begin with the unlikely origin story of Amicus.work, can you tell us a bit about what it is?" title="Direct link to Before we begin with the unlikely origin story of Amicus.work, can you tell us a bit about what it is?">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://amicus.work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amicus</a> is a SaaS tool for legal teams that helps keep you organized and on top of your legal needs. Think of it like "Asana for lawyers", but with features and workflows tailored to the domain of law. </p><p>It allows attorneys and their clients to easily track the progress of the legal case they are dealing with, and collaborate with others involved in the case, all in one central location. For example, deadline reminders help with not missing key dates and workflow visualization allows lawyer and client to see where the process is stuck, and get it unstuck.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-time-from-initial-idea-to-working-mvp-seemed-fast-how-long-was-it-and-how-did-you-achieve-it-so-quickly">Your time from initial idea to working MVP seemed fast. How long was it and how did you achieve it so quickly?<a href="#your-time-from-initial-idea-to-working-mvp-seemed-fast-how-long-was-it-and-how-did-you-achieve-it-so-quickly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your time from initial idea to working MVP seemed fast. How long was it and how did you achieve it so quickly?" title="Direct link to Your time from initial idea to working MVP seemed fast. How long was it and how did you achieve it so quickly?">​</a></h3><p>From the initial discussions to the launch of the initial prototype was probably a week or so. This is even quicker than it sounds because I was working a full time job at the time. The speed <!-- -->[of execution]<!-- --> was fully enabled by <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>, a full-stack web app framework.</p><p>I was looking at other solutions, but none of them were full-stack and sounded like a lot of work just to stitch everything together and get started. I just wanted to get the job done and didn’t care about picking the stack specifics myself. <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> was really helpful as it set me up with the best practices and I had everything running in just a few minutes!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-were-you-able-to-get-these-first-customers-so-quickly">How were you able to get these first customers so quickly?<a href="#how-were-you-able-to-get-these-first-customers-so-quickly" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How were you able to get these first customers so quickly?" title="Direct link to How were you able to get these first customers so quickly?">​</a></h3><p>The first user is a little bit of a cheat because I know them — my brother, who is a lawyer. But having read about other entrepreneurs, this is not that uncommon. Sometimes the first users we know are ourselves, sometimes they’re family or friends, and sometimes it’s someone you sought out. But I think it was important to have the client before the idea, because that way you have the problem before the solution.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-solopreneurs-regarding-the-validation-process">What advice would you give to other Solopreneurs regarding the validation process?<a href="#what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-solopreneurs-regarding-the-validation-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What advice would you give to other Solopreneurs regarding the validation process?" title="Direct link to What advice would you give to other Solopreneurs regarding the validation process?">​</a></h3><p>With regard to process, I spent a lot of time having discussions with my first user - my brother. The better you know the first user, the more careful you need to be I think. They’re going to give you slack and support your ideas. You don’t really want that, so you have to dive deeper into each problem/solution - like asking 5 why’s, so you can be more objective. </p><p>Once more users came on, I began sending out surveys about the key things I wanted to know. I also started setting up SQL queries and adding logs to answer questions about what kind of user was using what features the most etc. Being a solopreneur means you have to be even more careful about what you spend your time building.</p><p>MRR is low at the moment, around ~$90, and the first goal is to get to an MRR around ~$2,000. At that point I would be able to throw more time and resources at the application, increase the utility, and kick off a virtuous cycle of more revenue and utility.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thats-great-so-rather-than-trying-to-find-a-clever-idea-the-idea-found-you">That’s great. So rather than trying to find a clever idea, the idea found you.<a href="#thats-great-so-rather-than-trying-to-find-a-clever-idea-the-idea-found-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to That’s great. So rather than trying to find a clever idea, the idea found you." title="Direct link to That’s great. So rather than trying to find a clever idea, the idea found you.">​</a></h3><p>It’s funny because I have all of these harebrained ideas that I’m always kicking around, thinking about how to validate them: MVPs, setting up a landing page that gets emails or deposits, etc. </p><p>Meanwhile my brother was telling me about this pain of managing matters that no tool really helped with. Clients want to know where the process is, how many steps are left, how they need to be reminded of important dates like contract deadlines, etc. So I agreed to build something to see if it would help. <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> was instrumental here because if these steps had taken too long I would have probably lost interest and gotten distracted by something else. It allowed me to abstract all the details of a full stack app and focus on the product itself.</p><p>I built the prototype and it was TERRIBLE, it hurts to think back on that first version. But it was being used, and terrible though it was, it was still providing utility. And that was the point where it clicked the idea would work - if my first crude attempt was useful, and it would only get better with each iteration, there is a space here to provide so much value that some of it can be captured.</p><p>I guess it was less me having an idea and validating it, and more a valid idea coming to me and biting me in the ass, and me thinking ‘oh hey…’.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-been-the-biggest-lessons-learned-as-a-result-from-building-amicus-if-you-could-do-it-over-what-would-you-do-the-same-and-what-would-you-do-differently">What’s been the biggest lessons learned as a result from building Amicus? If you could do it over, what would you do the same and what would you do differently?<a href="#whats-been-the-biggest-lessons-learned-as-a-result-from-building-amicus-if-you-could-do-it-over-what-would-you-do-the-same-and-what-would-you-do-differently" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s been the biggest lessons learned as a result from building Amicus? If you could do it over, what would you do the same and what would you do differently?" title="Direct link to What’s been the biggest lessons learned as a result from building Amicus? If you could do it over, what would you do the same and what would you do differently?">​</a></h3><p>I think one of the things I would do differently is spend a little more time at the beginning getting a full grasp on the use cases. I tried doing this with interviews with the first client. However once what was intended was built, I come across all of these questions that weren’t initially obvious. I have seen PMs in the past create paper mockups (or using <a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a> if there is time) and walking a person through what they would do - then all of a sudden these assumptions you both had bubble up. <!-- -->[I]<!-- --> would probably do something like that if possible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-were-your-biggest-concerns-before-getting-started-building-amicus-what-problems-did-you-know-you-wanted-to-avoid-and-how-did-you-successfully-achieve-those-goals">What were your biggest concerns before getting started building Amicus?

What problems did you know you wanted to avoid and how did you successfully achieve those goals?" title="Direct link to What were your biggest concerns before getting started building Amicus? What problems did you know you wanted to avoid and how did you successfully achieve those goals?">​</a></h3><p>[My]<!-- --> biggest concern when getting started building <a href="https://amicus.work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amicus</a> was honestly that it would go to the unfinished project graveyard. Once again, <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> was key to resolving this. Being able to remove most of the redundancy involved in making a full stack app really helped me. It allowed me to focus on the interesting problems.</p><p>One of the things I have been trying to be careful to avoid is building things that aren’t needed or solving problems that don’t exist. It is very easy to get into the trap of thinking ‘oh this would be cool’ or ‘oh this extra thing might need to be build incase…’. I have been trying to be rigorous about validating features before building them (by talking to users or through the surveys), and unless theres a good reason to believe something is a problem I don’t spend my time fixing it. This is very hard, but it has allowed me to focus.</p><br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img style="width:500px" alt="Wasp Logo" src="/img/wasp-logo-wide.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="have-you-done-any-form-of-advertising-press-releases-how-are-you-spreading-the-word-about-amicus-at-the-moment">Have you done any form of advertising? press releases?

How are you spreading the word about Amicus at the moment?" title="Direct link to Have you done any form of advertising? press releases? How are you spreading the word about Amicus at the moment?">​</a></h3><p>No advertising yet and no press releases either. Right now spreading of the word is mostly through word of mouth. Advertising can be a money pit, especially when you don’t know what you’re doing (and I probably don’t know what I am doing) so I want to first make sure I am at the point where users feel passionate enough about Amicus to where they tell others about it. Once I get there, advertising can have a bigger return even with my fumbling. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-you-decide-to-go-it-alone-as-a-solopreneur-were-you-confident-that-youd-be-able-to-tackle-the-challenge-alone-and-if-so-why">What made you decide to go it alone as a “Solopreneur”? Were you confident that you’d be able to tackle the challenge alone, and if so why?<a href="#what-made-you-decide-to-go-it-alone-as-a-solopreneur-were-you-confident-that-youd-be-able-to-tackle-the-challenge-alone-and-if-so-why" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What made you decide to go it alone as a “Solopreneur”? Were you confident that you’d be able to tackle the challenge alone, and if so why?" title="Direct link to What made you decide to go it alone as a “Solopreneur”? Were you confident that you’d be able to tackle the challenge alone, and if so why?">​</a></h3><p>This wasn’t so much a decision as something that came about one decision at a time. What initially started as just a handy app for my brother to use, naturally grew in scope and utility, and all of a sudden there was a business and I effectively became a solopreneur. Although I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, I didn’t realize I had become a solopreneur until after the fact.</p><hr><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="/#signup">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<br><p>The web app framework you choose doesn’t <em>really</em> matter. Well, it matters, just not as much as others would like you to believe. </p><p>The fact that so many libraries and frameworks exist in 2023, and that <strong>the best one</strong> is <a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/self-fulfilling-prophecy-of-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still hotly debated</a>, proves my point. It’s the web developers biggest “first-world problem” — a problem that’s not really a problem. On Maslow’s <em>Hierarchy of Developer Needs,</em> it’s definitely near the top (ok, I made that up 😅)</p><br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="hierarchy of developer needs" src="/img/best-framework/hierarchy-of-dev-needs.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><br><p>For example, according the the <a href="https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StateOfJS</a> survey, there were 5 Front-end Frameworks with good retention in 2018, now there are 11 in 2022. That’s a 120% increase in a matter of 4 years, and that’s not even taking into account the hot meta-frameworks like NextJS, SvelteKit, or Astro!</p><br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="State of JS 2022" src="/img/best-framework/state-of-js.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">A growing family of frameworks...</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><br><p>These are great developments for the space, overall. They improve things like developer speed, bundle size, performance, and developer experience. But they also make it damn hard for developers and teams to make a decision when trying to decide which to use for their next project. It’s even worse for beginners, which is probably why they just go for React — which, of course, is perfectly fine. </p><p>And I think all of this is OK, because in the end it doesn’t really matter which one you choose. When it really comes down to it, all that matters is that the framework you chose:</p><ul><li>Is stable</li><li>Allows you to move quickly</li><li>Allows you to reach your end goal</li></ul><p>Why? Because most of them are built around the same concepts, have proven themselves capable of performing at scale, and have communities you can engage with and learn from. </p><p>React might be the most prominent in job descriptions, but if you’re looking for a new role and only have experience in Vue or Angular, I can’t imagine it would take you more than a week to build a side-project with React to display your ability to prospective employers.</p><p>On the flip side, if you’re a beginner or Junior dev, once you have the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS under your belt, it doesn’t really matter what framework you learn. I personally started learning backend development with Node/ExpressJS, but landed my first role as a Frontend developer with Angular. In my second role I used NextJS, and now I work with <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> (a full-stack framework built on top of React and ExpressJS). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl5HvBpUbt8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developers never stop learning</a>, so it’s kind of a non-argument to deride any specific framework — unless it really sucks, but then no one will continue to use it anyway.</p><br><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Use what works" src="/img/best-framework/midwitwasp.jpeg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><br><p>So, in the end, use what works. Because in 99.99% of cases, your choice of web framework will not decide the fate of your project.</p><p>If you’ve done a bit of research and found a framework that suits your needs and you enjoy using it — use it. There’s really no good reason not to.</p><br><hr><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="/#signup">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

That's still something I'd like to improve and make a habit of in the future.</p><p>A few other things we did prior to the launch:</p><ul><li><strong>Redesigned our project page</strong> - gave it a new, sleeker look</li><li><strong>Published <a href="/#showcases">use cases with our most successful users</a></strong> and featured them on the project page</li><li><strong>Activated our Discord and <a href="https://us4.campaign-archive.com/?u=8139c7de74df98aa17054b235&amp;id=1195fce664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email list</a></strong></li><li><strong>Organized a launch event</strong> (call on Discord) to celebrate the launch - it went better than expected, a decent amount of people showed up and we had some good discussions!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-launch">The launch<a href="#the-launch" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The launch" title="Direct link to The launch">​</a></h2><p>As mentioned, we went with a launch week format - we liked the idea of having a whole week filled with content rather than cramming everything in a single day. We highlighted a new feature every day + launched a hackathon on the last day of the week, to keep the momentum. You can see the full schedule <a href="/blog/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week">here</a>.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Launch week schedule" src="/img/beta-launch-review/launch-schedule.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>We also shared our launch news at different places, most successful being <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product Hunt</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33910997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerNews</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/z7xo9t/wasp_dsl_framework_for_building_fullstack_js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-hunt---failed-but-ok">Product Hunt - failed, but ok<a href="#product-hunt---failed-but-ok" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Product Hunt - failed, but ok" title="Direct link to Product Hunt - failed, but ok">​</a></h2><p>The mistake we did was launching on the Thanksgiving weekend - there was little (real) traffic + the mods were away so the bots took over!</p><p>We ended up as <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#5 product of the day</a> with ~250 upvotes, which wasn’t so bad because in the end we got featured in their daily newsletter with 1M+ subscribers.</p><p>The bad part was that mods were away and <strong>pretty much all other products in front of us were fake or obviously bot powered!</strong> It felt like there was no real interaction on any of these products, just endless “congrats on the launch” comments from the newly created accounts with obviously fake names. Two products were also clearly violating PH rules (one was the same product that launched a week or two ago, but just changed the name).</p><p>The most disappointing part for us (and especially for the team) was that it felt like there aren’t any real people on PH, just bots.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-post-launch-wasp-hackathon-1---betathon">🕹 Post-launch: Wasp Hackathon #1 - Betathon!<a href="#-post-launch-wasp-hackathon-1---betathon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🕹 Post-launch: Wasp Hackathon #1 - Betathon!" title="Direct link to 🕹 Post-launch: Wasp Hackathon #1 - Betathon!">​</a></h2><p>Since we introduced all the new features during the launch week, we thought a good way to keep the community engaged and give them a reason to try Wasp Beta out would be to throw a hackathon! It was the first time we did so we weren't sure how it'd go, but it went better than expected!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Tweet about Betathon - our #1 hackathon!" src="/img/beta-launch-review/hackathon-tweet.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>In the end, it was definitely worth it (<a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/01/11/betathon-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see review and submissions here</a>). It was quite lightweight to organize (we even made a <a href="https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom web app with Wasp for the hackathon</a> which you can also <a href="https://github.com/vincanger/wasp-betathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use for your hackathon</a>) and we got some really nice submissions and community shout-outs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="announcing-a-launch-date-publicly-is-great-for-productivity">Announcing a launch date publicly is great for productivity<a href="#announcing-a-launch-date-publicly-is-great-for-productivity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Announcing a launch date publicly is great for productivity" title="Direct link to Announcing a launch date publicly is great for productivity">​</a></h2><p>Another big benefit we noticed from this type of launching is how much more productive it made the whole team. Although the launch date was totally self-imposed (and we did move it a couple of times internally), it was still an amazing forcing function once we announced it publicly. It focused the efforts of the whole team and it also felt great.</p><p><strong>We decided to keep going with the quarterly release schedule in this format - 3 months is just enough time to make a dent on the product side, but not long enough to get stuck or caught up with endless refactoring</strong>. It also forces us to plan for the features that will have most impact on the developers using Wasp and make their lives easier, because we all want to have something cool and useful to present during the launch week.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>I hope you found this post helpful or at least interesting! Creating a new web framework might be one of the most notorious things to do as a developer, but that shouldn't be a reason not to do it - where are the new frameworks going to come from otherwise?</p><p><em>Want to stay in the loop? → <a href="/#signup">Join our newsletter!</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Being admirers of the work and style of Supabase, we drew a lot of inspiration from their “<a href="https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch week</a>” approach when preparing for our own Beta launch and hacakthon.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Wasp Betathon Homepage" src="/img/betathon/betathonpage.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Our dedicated hackathon landing page w/ intro video &amp; submission form</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>With some good inspiration in hand, we set off to create a simple, easy-going Hackathon experience. We weren’t certain we’d get many participants, so we decided to make the process as open as possible: <em>two weeks to work on any project using Wasp, alone or in a team of up to 4 people, submitted on our <a href="https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betathon Homepage</a> before the deadline</em>. That was it.</p><p>When you’re an early-stage startup, you can’t offer big cash prizes, so we asked Railway if they’d be interested in sponsoring some prizes, as we’re big fans of their deployment and hosting platform. Luckily, they agreed (thanks, Railway 🙏🚂). It was also a great match, since we already had the documentation for deploying Wasp apps to Railway on our website, making it an obvious choice for the participants to deploy their Hackathon apps with.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Keyboard" src="/img/betathon/keyboard.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Disclaimer: actual prize keyboard will be cooler and waspier 😎🐝</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>On top of that, we decided that a cool grand prize could be a Wasp-colored mechanical keyboard. Nothing fancy, but keyboards are an item a lot of programmers love. We also threw in some Wasp beanies and shirts, and stated that we’d spotlight the winner’s on our platforms and social media accounts. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="promotion">Promotion<a href="#promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Promotion" title="Direct link to Promotion">​</a></h2><p>For the Wasp Beta Launch Week, we were active and publicising Wasp on many platforms. We didn’t outright promote the hackathon on those platforms, but we were getting a lot of incoming interest to our Website and Discord, so we made noise about it there. We posted banners on the homepage, and made announcements on Discord and Twitter that directed people to a <a href="https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beta Hacakthon homepage</a> we created.</p><p>The homepage was nice to have as a central spot for all the rules and relevant info. We also added a fun intro video to give the hackathon a more personal touch. I also think the effort put into making an intro video gives participants the feeling that they’re entering into a serious contest and committing to something of substance.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Hackathon Wasp app repo" src="/img/betathon/github.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Wanna host your own Hackathon? Use our template app!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>As an extra bonus, we wrote the Betathon Homepage with Wasp, and put the <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/examples/hackathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code up on our GitHub</a>. We thought it might inspire people to build with Wasp, using it as a guide while creating their own projects for the hackathon, plus it could be used by others in the future if they want to host their own hackathon. 💻</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-response">The Response<a href="#the-response" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Response" title="Direct link to The Response">​</a></h3><p>The response overall was small but significant, considering Wasp’s age. We were also extremely happy with the quality of the engagement. We had thirteen participants register overall, a nice number considering we only started promoting the hackathon on the day that we announced it (this is probably something we’d do differently next time)!</p><p>We also asked participants for their feedback on participating in the Hackathon, and they were all pleased with the open, straight-forward approach we took, so we’ll most likely be repeating this for future versions. Other good signs were the many comments that participants were eager to take part in our next hackathon, as well as some dedicated new community members, which makes it all the more motivating for us. 💪</p><hr><p><strong>A big THANK YOU again to all the participants for their hard work and feedback. Here’s to the next one! 🍻</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

It’s amazing. But there’s also some very valid criticism: that it’s simply taking the grunt work out of programming by writing boilerplate for us, which we as developers have to maintain! </p><div style="margin-bottom:1rem"><a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1600447377248116736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rgubux630836d05mje5.png" alt="I expected technology to make programming less laborious, as it does to most things. But I have to admit I expected it to happen by programmers switching to more powerful languages, rather than continuing to write programs full of boilerplate, but having AIs generate most of it." class="img_ev3q"></a></div><p>PG is totally right in his remark above, but what he doesn’t realize is that there are languages out there that attempt to overcome this very problem, and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a> is one of them. </p><p>What makes Wasp unique is that it’s a framework that uses a super simple <strong>language</strong> to help you build your web app: front-end, server, and deployment. But it’s not a complicated language like Java or Python, it’s more similar to SQL or JSON, so the learning curve is really quick (technically, it’s a <em>Domain Specific Langauge</em> or <em>DSL</em>). </p><p>Check it out for yourself:</p><div class="language-wasp codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

Which means AI can probably work with it easily as well.

No more endless boilerplate!</p><p>So that’s exactly what we set to find out in the video above. The results? Well let’s just say they speak for themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This enabled each editor to implement this logic for interacting with language servers only once, and then it can be used for any language server!</p><p>This is great for us, language creators, because it means that once we implement a language server for our language, most of the work is done, and the work we need to do per each editor is manageable.</p><p>Right now WLS is used only by the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode Wasp language extension</a>, but thanks to the nature of the Language Server Protocol, it should be relatively easy to add support for other editors too!

It already comes bundled with your installation of <code>wasp</code> → so if you can run <code>wasp</code> projects on your machine, you already have WLS, and it is always of the correct version needed for your current wasp installation. The only thing you need to ensure is you have <code>wasp</code> version ≥ 0.6, and a relatively fresh VSCode Wasp language extension.</p><p>An easy way to check that your version of <code>wasp</code> has WLS packaged into it is to run it and look at its usage instructions: it should mention <code>waspls</code> as one of the commands.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="" src="/img/beta-ide-improvements/wasp-cli-waspls.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h1>Wasp VSCode extension</h1><p>If we would call Wasp Language Server (WLS) the “backend”, then <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode Wasp language extension</a> would be “frontend” → it takes care of everything to ensure you have a nice experience working with Wasp in VSCode, while delegating the hardest work to the WLS.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="" src="/img/beta-ide-improvements/wasp-vscode-extension.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>For curious, you can check out its source code here, core of it is just one file: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/src/extension.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/src/extension.ts</a></p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features-1">Features<a href="#features-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax highlighting<a href="#syntax-highlighting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Syntax highlighting" title="Direct link to Syntax highlighting">​</a></h3><p>Nothing unexpected here: it recognizes different parts of Wasp syntax, like type, value, identifier, comment, string, … and colors them appropriately.</p><p>If you are curious how is this implemented, check <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/syntaxes/wasp.tmLanguage.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/syntaxes/wasp.tmLanguage.yaml</a> → the whole syntax of Wasp is described via this “mysterious” old TextMate format, since that is the way to do it in VSCode.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="snippets">Snippets<a href="#snippets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Snippets" title="Direct link to Snippets">​</a></h3><p>Wasp allows you to quickly generate a snippet of code for a new <code>page</code>, <code>query</code>, <code>action</code>, or <code>entity</code>!</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="" src="/img/beta-ide-improvements/wls-snippets.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Check out our snippet definitions here: <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/snippets/wasp.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/snippets/wasp.json</a> .

We resolved this by somewhat changing the structure of the Wasp project and also adding tsconfig.json files that provide IDE with the information needed to correctly analyze the JS/TS source files.</p><p>To learn more about Typescript support in Wasp Beta, check <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/11/29/typescript-feature-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>!</p><h1>What does the future hold?</h1><p>While Wasp Beta greatly improved IDE support for Wasp, there are still quite a few things we want to improve on:</p><ol><li>Smarter autocompletion via WLS.<ol><li>Right now it suggests any expression when you need an expression. In the future, we want it to know exactly what is the type of needed expression, and suggest only expressions of that type! So if I am in <code>route ... { to: &lt;my_cursor_here&gt; }</code>, then I want to see only <code>page</code>s among the suggested completions, not <code>queries</code> or <code>actions</code> or something else.</li><li>Further, we would also like it to autocomplete on dictionary fields → so if I am in <code>route ... { &lt;my_cursor_here&gt; }</code>, it should offer me <code>path</code> and <code>to</code> as completions, as those are only valid fields in the <code>route</code> dictionary.</li></ol></li><li>Extensions for other editors besides VSCode. Now that we have Wasp Language Server, these shouldn’t be too hard to implement! This is also a great task for potential contributors: check this <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GH issue</a> if you are interested.</li><li>Implement Wasp code formatter. We could make it a part of WLS, and then have the editor extension call it on save.</li><li>Improve support for PSL (Prisma Schema Language) in .wasp files.</li></ol><p>If any of these sound interesting, feel free to join us on our <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, or join the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to announce that Wasp actions now feature native support for optimistic updates!
Continue reading to to find out what optimistic updates are and how Wasp implements them.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Wasp TS support" src="/img/opt-updates-banner.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-optimistic-updates-anyway">What are Optimistic Updates Anyway?<a href="#what-are-optimistic-updates-anyway" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are Optimistic Updates Anyway?" title="Direct link to What are Optimistic Updates Anyway?">​</a></h2><p>Think about an interactive web app you use daily. It could be almost anything (e.g., Reddit, Youtube, Facebook). It almost certainly features UI elements you can interact with without refreshing the page, such as upvotes on Reddit or likes on Youtube.</p><p>All these small actions play out in the same manner. Let's look at Reddit upvotes as an example:</p><ol><li>You click on the upvote button</li><li>Your browser sends a request to the server to save the upvote</li><li>The server saves your upvote to the database and sends a successful response to your browser</li><li>Your browser receives the successful response and reflects the change in the UI (i.e., you see your upvote)</li></ol><p>The client&nbsp;<em>waits</em>&nbsp;for the server's confirmation&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;updating the UI because actions can sometimes fail. Well, at least that was the original idea.</p><p>These days, many popular websites update their UIs&nbsp;<em>without waiting</em>&nbsp;for servers' responses. Most of the time, everything goes as expected: you click on an upvote, and the server returns a successful response a couple of seconds later (depending on how fast your connection is). Since programmers want their users to have a snappier experience, instead of waiting for a confirmation, they update the UI immediately (as if the action were successful) and then roll back if the server doesn't return a successful response (which rarely happens). This pattern of optimistically updating the UI before receiving the confirmation of success is called, you guessed it, an&nbsp;<strong>Optimistic Update</strong>.</p><p>Most popular modern websites use optimistic updates to some degree. As mentioned, Reddit uses them for upvotes and downvotes, Youtube uses them for likes, and Trello uses them when moving cards between lists.</p><p>Optimistic updates are a significant UX improvement, but since they introduce additional state (which can get out of sync with the server), they can be tricky to get right. Then there's also the issue of writing additional code for managing the cache and rolling back the changes if the request ends up failing. Luckily, we're here to help!</p><p>Wasp recently added native support for optimistic updates, and the rest of this post demonstrates how to quickly set it up in your Wasp application.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-wasp-todo-app-without-optimistic-updates">A Wasp Todo App Without Optimistic Updates<a href="#a-wasp-todo-app-without-optimistic-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Wasp Todo App Without Optimistic Updates" title="Direct link to A Wasp Todo App Without Optimistic Updates">​</a></h2><p>To honor the tradition of demonstrating UIs using Todo apps, We'll show you how to improve the UX of toggling an item's status when working with a slow connection.

need, the rest of the code (i.e., <code>main.wasp</code>, <code>queries.js</code> and <code>actions.js</code>) remains the same.

Instead, it updates the cache optimistically, continues waiting for the response, and rolls back the changes if the action fails (Wasp internally handles all of this). As previously mentioned, simple changes such as this one rarely fail. Therefore, most of the time, the user enjoys their snappier experience without ever knowing anything special is happening in the background.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-makes-optimistic-updates-difficult">What Makes Optimistic Updates Difficult<a href="#what-makes-optimistic-updates-difficult" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Makes Optimistic Updates Difficult" title="Direct link to What Makes Optimistic Updates Difficult">​</a></h2><p>There's an old software engineering joke you're probably familiar with:</p><blockquote><p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p></blockquote><p>Optimistically updating a query involves plenty of meddling with the client-side cache, which is bound to come with a few gotchas. Examples include the answers to questions such as:</p><ul><li>What happens when an optimistically updated action fails?</li><li>What happens when the user uses the optimistically updated data in a new action?</li><li>What happens when the user performs a different action that affects the same cached data as the optimistically updated one?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>Notice how Wasp users don't need to know about any of these issues when using our optimistic updates API. They only need to tell Wasp which query they wish to update and how, and Wasp takes care of the rest.</p><p>Wasp internally uses&nbsp;<a href="https://tanstack.com/query/v4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Query</a>, an excellent asynchronous state management library we'll gladly recommend to anyone. While React Query does solve some of these problems and helps with some of the rest, we still had to implement quite a complex mechanism to fully cover all edge cases.</p><p>Describing this mechanism, although technically interesting, is beyond the scope of a feature announcement. But stay tuned because in a future blog post, we'll be taking a deep dive into the infrastructure Wasp uses to ensure optimistic updates are performed correctly and consistently.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Wasp, we are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React &amp; Node.js.<br>
<!-- -->This requires us to deeply understand different parts of what constitutes a web app, in order to be able to model them in our DSL.</p><p>Recently our focus was on access control, and I decided to capture the learnings in this blog post, to help others quickly get up to speed on how to do access control in web apps.<br>

<!-- -->If that is so, should we at all check permissions on the frontend, and what is the purpose of that?<br>
<strong>The main reason for doing any permissions checks on the frontend is ergonomics/user experience</strong> -&gt; by having UI focus only on resources they can change, we make it easier for users to understand what they can do in our web app and make sure they don't waste time on trying to describe complex operations that server will then not be able to execute.</p><p>So, for example, our frontend code can hide/omit certain fields in the UI form if the user shouldn't be able to access them, it can prevent opening certain pages, or hide/omit certain buttons if they trigger operations that the user is not allowed to perform.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Example of using casl.js in React" src="/img/permissions-in-web-apps/casl-react-example.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Example of using casl.js in React to show button only if the user has permission.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p><strong>Takeaway: Permission checks on frontend are not there for security, but only for ergonomics / improving user experience.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backend-server">Backend (server)<a href="#backend-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backend (server)" title="Direct link to Backend (server)">​</a></h3><p>The server is <strong>a crucial place to implement access control</strong>. It exposes an API that the frontend (browser) and/or other services consume. While doing that, they authenticate with the server, so that server knows who they are, and then they ask (i.e. via REST API or GraphQL API) the server to execute certain operations (i.e. creating, updating, or fetching something). It is the server’s job to figure out if they are allowed (authorized) to perform those operations (on specified resources / with provided arguments) and to reject them if they are not.</p><p>At its core, permissions checks on the server are here to <strong>check for each API endpoint</strong> if the caller is allowed to execute it. Often they are executed at the very start of the API endpoint logic, but often they are also intertwined with the rest of the endpoint handler logic.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Example of permissions check in backend." src="/img/permissions-in-web-apps/backend-permissions-check-example.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Example of doing permission check at the start of API endpoint (is user authenticated) and then also doing another check as part of the database query (is user owner of the article they are trying to delete).</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Besides defining checks at API/operation level, they are also often defined at the <strong>data/model level</strong>. This means that they are tied to specific data models (normally from the database), as part of data access logic (ORM), and are defining who can access specific field(s), or even the whole data model.</p><p>Example of attaching permission checks to the data model directly in the GraphQL schema (<a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-directive-permissions-authorization-made-easy-54c076b5368e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from this blog post</a>):</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Example of attaching permission checks to the data model directly in the GraphQL schema" src="/img/permissions-in-web-apps/data-model-permissions-gql.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>For a more sophisticated RBAC approach, with an additional layer of indirection (permissions), read on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="database">Database<a href="#database" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Database" title="Direct link to Database">​</a></h3><p>Usually, users don’t have direct access to the database at all, instead, they affect it via the server. <strong>In such a case, there is no need to do specific database access control</strong> besides normal constraints that you will have in your DB to ensure data model integrity, like uniqueness, validations, and similar. That said, in some situations, you might want to do it, but we will not get into that in this article.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-common-approaches-rbac-abac-">3.

Common approaches (RBAC, ABAC, …)">​</a></h2><p>The most common approaches to access control are <strong>RBAC</strong> (Role-Based Access Control) and <strong>ABAC</strong> (Attribute-Based Access Control), with RBAC having the strong lead (but ABAC is picking up).</p><p>Although less popular, we will also shortly mention ReBAC as an “in-between” option.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rbac---role-based-access-control">RBAC - Role-based access control<a href="#rbac---role-based-access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to RBAC - Role-based access control" title="Direct link to RBAC - Role-based access control">​</a></h3><p>Roles rule :D! In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RBAC</a>, roles are the central concept. Some example roles might be <code>admin</code>, <code>guest</code>, <code>writer</code>, <code>moderator</code>, …. When determining if a certain user has access, <strong>we check their roles and determine their access rights based on it</strong>. For example, <code>admin</code> can delete other users, articles, and projects, but <code>guest</code> can’t modify any resources, only read articles.</p><p>Pro advice (thanks Karan!): While we could be checking the user’s roles directly in the permission checks, it is even better (and recommended by OWASP) to add a layer of indirection → permissions. <strong>So roles are attached to users, permissions are attached to roles, and permission checks check permissions</strong> (who would expect that :)!?).</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Users -> Roles -> Permissions" src="/img/permissions-in-web-apps/users-roles-permissions.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>For example, a user might have role <code>admin</code>, and role <code>admin</code> has permissions <code>updateArticle</code> and <code>deleteArticle</code> attached to it. Then, when determining if a user can delete the article, we first fetch his role, then we fetch the permissions attached to that role, and finally check if <code>deleteArticle</code> is present among those → if so, they can continue with the deletion!</p><p>This way, if we decide a certain role should have more or fewer permissions, we just add or remove the permission in question to the role, and that is it! We don’t have to go through every permission check and update its logic (which we would have to do if we were checking directly against roles).</p><p><strong>RBAC is popular because it is relatively simple and it reflects the basic business domain pretty well</strong> - often we are thinking in the terms of roles in the real world, so it is easy to grasp and understand. There are plenty of solutions and frameworks out there that implement RBAC.</p><p>While a good match for many common use cases, there is a drawback to RBAC - when access control becomes complex (which usually happens as the web app evolves and grows big), RBAC sometimes fails in offering needed granularity in an elegant way, resulting in unwieldy and overly-complex access control logic.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="abac---attribute-based-access-control">ABAC - Attribute-based access control<a href="#abac---attribute-based-access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ABAC - Attribute-based access control" title="Direct link to ABAC - Attribute-based access control">​</a></h3><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABAC</a>, key idea is that you define <strong>a bunch of access control rules</strong> where each rule takes different “attributes” as input. When you need to check if a user is authorized to do smth, you run the rules and <strong>if all the rules pass, it is a go</strong>, but if a single rule fails, it is a no go.</p><p>Rule attributes can be anything, but usually, they fall into 4 categories:</p><ol><li><strong>Subject</strong>: information about a user (i.e. user’s id or name)</li><li><strong>Action</strong>: operation they want to perform (i.e. reading an Article)</li><li><strong>Object</strong>: resources they want to operate on (i.e. an Article),</li><li><strong>Environment/context:</strong> i.e. current time of the day or number of previous requests that the user did in the last hour.</li></ol><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="ABAC diagram" src="/img/permissions-in-web-apps/abac-diagram.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Let’s observe the example from before where we wanted to know if user is allowed to delete an article.<br>
<!-- -->In ABAC, we could define an action “deleteArticle”, and then define a rule that takes user(subject), action, object, and additional context. That rule would check if action is “deleteArticle” → if so, it would evaluate if user is allowed to delete the article specified as an object, by checking some properties of user, maybe even role, or by checking if user is owner of that article.<br>
<!-- -->Then, when user actually issues a command to delete an article, we would ask our access control system to run it against all the rules it has, while giving it the (user, “deleteArticle”, article, context) tuple → most of the rules would say all is ok since they are not concerned with “deleteArticle” action, but the ones that are (like the one we defined above) must all pass in order to actually allow the access.</p><p><strong>ABAC is very flexible and general as an approach</strong>, and you could easily implement RBAC (and many other approaches) in ABAC (by checking the user’s role as one of the attributes) → therefore it is more general/expressive than RBAC.</p><p>However, ABAC is more complex to implement, and it is also more expensive performance-wise, due to needing to check multiple rules each time that access control check is being performed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rebac---relationship-based-access-control">ReBAC - Relationship-based access control<a href="#rebac---relationship-based-access-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ReBAC - Relationship-based access control" title="Direct link to ReBAC - Relationship-based access control">​</a></h3><p>Roles (RBAC) can be lacking when you need to grant access based on relationship-related questions like “is this user owner of this article” or “does this user belong to this workspace”.</p><p>While ABAC can easily handle this, you could also consider it a bit too powerful if all you need to describe are relationships → and this is where ReBAC comes in.</p><p>While there are different ways one could go about implementing ReBAC, the simplest one is to build on top of RBAC by introducing a concept of “relationship” rules to your access control logic and then checking those alongside the roles. So RBAC with a dash of ABAC (focused on relationships).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-owasp-recommendations">4.

<!-- -->An interesting finding is that even though the sample is pretty small, it is clear that devs prefer RBAC over OWASP-recommended ABAC.<br>

For example, if we are using NodeJS with ExpressJS for our server and writing middleware that handles HTTP API requests, we will add a bit of logic into that middleware that does some checks to ensure a user can actually perform that action. Or maybe we will embed “checks” into our database queries so that we query only what the user is allowed to access. Often a combination.</p><p>What can be dangerous with such an organic approach is the complexity that arises as the codebase grows - if we don’t put enough effort into centralizing and structuring our access control logic, it can become very hard to reason about it and to do consistent updates to it, leading to mistakes and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Imagine having to modify the web app so that user can now only read their own articles and articles of their friends, while before they were allowed to read any article. If there is only one place where we can make this update, we will have a nice time, but if there are a bunch of places and we need to hunt those down first and then make sure they are all updated in the same way, we are in for a lot of trouble and lot of space to make mistakes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-an-existing-solution">Using an existing solution<a href="#using-an-existing-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using an existing solution" title="Direct link to Using an existing solution">​</a></h3><p>Instead of figuring out on our own how to structure the access control code, often it is a better choice to use an existing access control solution! Besides not having to figure and implement everything on your own, another big advantage is that these solutions are battle-tested, which is very important for the code dealing with the security of your web app.</p><p>We can roughly divide these solutions into frameworks and (external) providers, where frameworks are embedded into your web app and shipped together with it, while providers are externally hosted and usually paid services.</p><p>A couple of popular solutions:</p><ol><li><a href="https://casbin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://casbin.org/</a> (multiple approaches, multiple languages, provider)<ol><li>Open source authZ library that has support for many access control models (ACL, RBAC, ABAC, …) and many languages (Go, Java, Node.js, JS, Rust, …).

Wasp finally allows you to write your code in TypeScript (i.e., the most popular web technology after JavaScript) on both the front-end and the back-end.</p><p>You can now define and use types in any part of your code, enjoying all benefits of the static type checker. At the time of writing, not all parts of Wasp are typed as well as they could be, but we're working on it!
Exposing all Wasp functionalities through informative typed interfaces is one of our top priorities.</p><p>Without further ado, let's see how we can use TypeScript with Wasp.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setting-up-a-typescript-project-in-wasp">Setting up a TypeScript project in Wasp<a href="#setting-up-a-typescript-project-in-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setting up a TypeScript project in Wasp" title="Direct link to Setting up a TypeScript project in Wasp">​</a></h2><p>Let's start by creating a fresh Wasp project:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">wasp new myApp</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>This will generate a project skeleton in the folder <code>myApp</code>. The project structure is different than before, and there are now several additional generated files that help with IDE and TypeScript support. So let's explain it:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├── .gitignore</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├── main.wasp             # Your wasp code goes here.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├── src</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── client            # Your client code (JS/CSS/HTML) goes here.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── Main.css</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── MainPage.jsx</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── react-app-env.d.ts</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── tsconfig.json</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── waspLogo.png</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── server            # Your server code (Node JS) goes here.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── tsconfig.json</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── shared            # Your shared (runtime independent) code goes here.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── tsconfig.json</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── .waspignore</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">└── .wasproot</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>At this point, we can choose one of three options:</p><ol><li>We write our code exclusively in JavaScript.</li><li>We write our code exclusively in TypeScript.</li><li>We write some parts of our code in JavaScript, and other parts in TypeScript.</li></ol><p>Since the third option is a superset of the first two, that's what Wasp currently supports. In other words, regardless of whether you want your entire codebase in one of these languages or you want to mix it up, there's no extra configuration necessary!
Simply use the appropriate extension (<code>.ts</code> and <code>.tsx</code> for TypeScript; <code>.js</code> and <code>.jsx</code> for JavaScript), and your IDE and Wasp will know what to do.</p><p>To demonstrate this, let's start Wasp and change <code>MainPage.jsx</code> to <code>MainPage.tsx</code>:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">wasp start</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">mv src/client/MainPage.jsx src/client/MainPage.tsx</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>That's it! Wasp will notice the change and recompile, and your app will continue to work. The only difference is that you can now write TypeScript in <code>MainPage.tsx</code> and get helpful information from your IDE and the static type checker. Try removing an import and see what happens.</p><p>The same applies to any file you may want to include in your project. Specify the language you wish to use via the extension, and Wasp will do the rest!</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Even if you use TypeScript and have a <em>server</em> file called <code>someFile.ts</code>, you must still import it as if it had the <code>.js</code> extension (i.e., <code>import foo from 'someFile.js'</code>). Wasp internally uses <code>esnext</code> module resolution, which always requires specifying the extension as <code>.js</code> (i.e., the extension used in the emitted JS file). This applies to all <code>@server</code> imports (and files on the server in general).</p><p>Read more about ES modules in TypeScript <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Thanks to Webpack, you don't need to write extensions when working with client-side imports.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="moving-existing-projects-to-the-new-structure-and-optionally-typescript">Moving existing projects to the new structure (and optionally TypeScript)<a href="#moving-existing-projects-to-the-new-structure-and-optionally-typescript" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Moving existing projects to the new structure (and optionally TypeScript)" title="Direct link to Moving existing projects to the new structure (and optionally TypeScript)">​</a></h2><p>If you wish to move an existing project to the new structure, the easiest approach comes down to creating a new project and moving all the files from your old project into appropriate locations. After doing this, you can choose which files you'd like to implement in TypeScript, change the extension and go for it.</p><p>To avoid digging too deep, this is all we'll say about migrating.

When you're confident you've got all of them, continue reading.</p><p>Let's see what happens when we bring TypeScript into the picture. Remember, we only need to change the extension to <code>tsx</code>. After we do this, The IDE will warn us about missing type definitions, so let's fill these in. While we're at it, we can also tell <code>useQuery</code> what types it's working with by specifying its type arguments.</p><p>Here's how our code looks after these changes:</p><div

align="center"></p><figure><img alt="TypeScript erros" src="/img/typescript-errors.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">The errors are pretty simple (almost as if we've made them up for this example :)</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><ol><li>The first error warns us that <code>tasks</code> might be <code>undefined</code> (e.g., on the first render), which <code>TaskList</code> does not expect</li><li>The second error tells us that the property <code>len</code> does not exist on the array <code>tasks</code>. In other words, we misspelled <code>length</code>.</li><li>Finally, the third error tells us that the type <code>Task</code> does not contain the field <code>isdone</code>. This is also a typo. The field's name should be <code>isDone</code>.</li></ol><p>Thanks to TypeScript, we can quickly fix all three errors, saving us a lot of time we'd probably lose by hunting them down manually or, even worse, during runtime.</p><div class="language-tsx codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre

While we can define the type in <code>src/shared</code> to avoid writing (almost) the same code on both the server and the client, we'll still have duplication between the code in <code>src/shared</code> and our <code>.wasp</code> file.</p><p>The good news is that we know about this, also find it annoying, and are working to fix it as soon as possible! In the near future, Wasp will generate types from entities and allow you to access them using <code>@wasp</code> imports. Other improvements exist, too. For example, Wasp could read your query declarations and provide you with the correct type for the <code>context</code> object in their definitions. Another possible improvement is automatically typing queries on the front-end, and then relying on type inference to correctly type <code>useQuery</code> (instead of users specifying its type arguments explicitly).</p><p>In short, there's a long and exciting path ahead of us, full of interesting possibilities. So stick with Wasp and see how far we can make it!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Beta is coming" src="/img/why-we-chose-prisma/wasp-loves-prisma.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Wasp is a full-stack JS web dev framework, covering frontend, backend, and database. When choosing the solution to build our database layer on top, we chose Prisma, even though it was still somehwat new tech at that point, and we believe today we made a great choice -&gt; read on to learn why!</p><p>At Wasp, <a href="/docs/vision">we aim</a> to simplify full-stack web development via a specialized high-level language. This language allows you to describe the main parts of your web app succinctly, avoiding a lot of usual boilerplate and configuration while giving you lots of features and ensuring best practices. Wasp is essentially a full-stack web framework implemented as a specialized language that works with React &amp; Node.js!</p><p>When we started working on Wasp, we wanted to keep it easy to learn and to the point, so we decided:</p><ul><li>the Wasp language should only be used at a high level, so you would still use React, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, etc. to implement your custom logic. If a full-stack web app is an orchestra, Wasp is the conductor.</li><li>the Wasp language should be declarative and simple, very similar to JSON, but “smarter” in the sense it understands web app concepts and makes sure your app follows them.</li></ul><p>With that in mind, we focused on identifying high-level web app concepts that are worth capturing in the Wasp language. We identified the following parts of a web app:</p><ul><li>General app info (title, head, favicon, …)</li><li>Pages and Routes</li><li>Data Models (aka Entities), e.g. User, Task, Organization, Article, … .</li><li>Operations (communication between client and server; CRUD on data models, 3rd party APIs, …)</li><li>Deployment</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entities">Entities<a href="#entities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Entities" title="Direct link to Entities">​</a></h2><p>Of all of those, Entities are in the middle of everything, present through the whole codebase, and are central to all the other parts of the web app: client, server, and database. They were, however, also the most daunting part to implement!</p><p>When we started, we imagined an Entity would look something like this in Wasp:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">entity User {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  id: Id,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  username: String @unique,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  email: String @unique</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  groups: [Group]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>While adding this initial syntax to our language was feasible, there were also much bigger tasks to tackle in order to make this a proper solution:</p><ul><li>expand syntax to be flexible enough for real-life use cases</li><li>support migrations (data and schema)</li><li>generate code that users can call from JS/TS to query and update entities in the DB</li><li>and probably a lot of other things that we hadn’t even thought of yet!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mongoose-sequelize--or-prisma">Mongoose, Sequelize, … or Prisma?<a href="#mongoose-sequelize--or-prisma" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mongoose, Sequelize, … or Prisma?" title="Direct link to Mongoose, Sequelize, … or Prisma?">​</a></h2><p>We already decided that we would pick an ORM(ish) solution for JS/TS which we would build the rest of the features on top of. We started evaluating different ones: Mongoose, Sequelize, TypeORM, … .</p><p>But then we looked at Prisma, and the winner was clear! Not only was Prisma taking care of everything that we cared about, but it had one additional feature that made it a perfect fit:</p><div class="language-prisma codeBlockContainer_Ckt0

in having a special, declarative language for describing data models (schema), and it was exactly what we needed for Wasp.</p><p>So instead of implementing our own syntax for describing Entities, we decided to use Prisma and their PSL to describe Entities (data models) inside the Wasp language.</p><p>Today, Entities are described like this in Wasp language:</p><div class="language-wasp

describe an entity!</p><p>Another great thing is that the PSL is at its core a pretty simple language, so we <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/src/Wasp/Psl/Parser/Model.hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implemented our own parser</a> for it → that means that Wasp actually understands what you wrote, even though it is PSL, and can fully work with it. So we lost nothing by using PSL instead of our own syntax and instead gained all the features that Prisma brings.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-benefits">Other Benefits<a href="#other-benefits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other Benefits" title="Direct link to Other Benefits">​</a></h2><p>Besides PSL, there were plenty of other reasons why we felt Prisma is a great fit for us:</p><ul><li>It is targeting Javascript / Typescript.</li><li>It takes care of migrations and has a nice workflow for doing it.</li><li>It supports different databases: Mongo, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, …, which is very important for Wasp since our vision is to support different stacks in the future.</li><li>It has Prisma Studio - UI for inspecting your database, which we also make available to you via Wasp CLI.</li><li>It keeps improving quickly and is very focused on a nice developer experience, which is also our focus here at Wasp.</li><li>Community is extremely welcoming and the core team is super helpful - all of our questions and issues were answered super quickly!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="challenges">Challenges<a href="#challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges" title="Direct link to Challenges">​</a></h2><p>While integrating Prisma into Wasp went really smoothly, there were a few hiccups:</p><ul><li>Getting Prisma CLI to provide interactive output while being called programmatically by Wasp was tricky, and in the end, we had to use a bit of a dirty approach to trick the Prisma CLI into thinking it is called interactively. We opened an issue for this with Prisma, so hopefully, we will be able to remove this once it is resolved: <a href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7113</a>.</li><li>In the early days, there were some bugs, however, they were always quickly solved, so updating to the newest Prisma version was often the solution.</li><li>It took us a bit of fiddling to get Prisma to work with its schema outside of the server’s root directory, but we did get it working in the end!</li></ul><p>Most of these were due to us stretching the boundaries of how Prisma was imagined to be used, but in total Prisma proved to be fairly flexible!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>With its declarative language for describing schema, focus on ergonomics, and JS/TS as the target language, Prisma was really a stroke of luck for us - if not for it, it would have taken much more effort to get the Entities working in Wasp.</p><p>When we started using it, Prisma was still somewhat early, and it was certainly the least-mature technology in our stack - but we decided to bet on it because it was just a perfect fit, and it made so much sense. Today, with Prisma being a mature and popular solution, we are more than happy we made that choice!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future">Future<a href="#future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future" title="Direct link to Future">​</a></h2><p>Already, Prisma is playing a big role at Wasp, but there is still more that we plan and want to do:</p><ul><li>support Prisma’s Enum and Type declarations</li><li>expose more of Prisma’s CLI commands, especially database seeding</li><li>add support in Wasp for multiple databases (which Prisma already supports)</li><li>improve IDE support for PSL within the Wasp language</li></ul><p>If you are interested in helping with any of these, reach out to us on this issue <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/641</a>, or in any case, join us on our <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>!</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his free time, Erlis enjoys working on side projects, which is also how <a href="https://www.amicus.work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amicus</a> started out.</p><p><a href="https://www.amicus.work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amicus</a> is a SaaS for legal teams - think about it as "Asana for lawyers", but with features and workflows tailored to the domain of law.</p><p>Read on to learn how long it took Erlis to develop the first version of his SaaS with Wasp, how he got his first paying customers, and what features he plans to add next!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-for-a-full-stack-all-in-one-solution-with-react--nodejs">Looking for a full-stack “all-in-one” solution, with React &amp; Node.js<a href="#looking-for-a-full-stack-all-in-one-solution-with-react--nodejs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking for a full-stack “all-in-one” solution, with React &amp; Node.js" title="Direct link to Looking for a full-stack “all-in-one” solution, with React &amp; Node.js">​</a></h2><p>Erlis first learned about Wasp on HackerNews and it immediately caught his attention, particularly the configuration language part. One of the companies he worked at in the past had its own internal DSL in the hardware domain, and he understood how helpful it could be for moving fast and avoiding boilerplate.</p><p>Erlis also had previous experience in web development, especially on the front-end side in React and Javascript, so that made Wasp a logical choice.</p><blockquote><p>I was looking at other solutions, but none of them were full-stack and sounded like a lot of work just to stitch everything together and get started. I just wanted to get the job done and didn’t care about picking the stack specifics myself. Wasp was really helpful as it set me up with the best practices and I had everything running in just a few minutes!</p><p>— Erlis Kllogjri - Amicus</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-amicus-v10-and-getting-first-customers">Building Amicus v1.0 and getting first customers!<a href="#building-amicus-v10-and-getting-first-customers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building Amicus v1.0 and getting first customers!" title="Direct link to Building Amicus v1.0 and getting first customers!">​</a></h2><p>The idea for Amicus came from his brother, who is employed at a law firm - talking about their process and challenges in executing them, Erlis thought it would be an interesting side project, especially given there is a real problem to solve.</p><p>Soon, the first version of Amicus was live! It was made in a true lean startup fashion, starting with the essential features and immediately being tested with users.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Amicus's dashboard" src="/img/amicus-usecase/amicus-dashboard.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Amicus's dashboard, using Material-UI</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Erlis used Material-UI as a UI library since it came with one of the example apps built in Wasp (Beta introduced Tailwind support!). Users could track their clients, active legal matters and there was even integrated billing with Stripe! Amicus also extensively used Wasp’s <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Async Jobs</a> feature to regularly update invoices, send reminder emails and clear out old data from the database.</p><p>After a few iterations with the legal team who were Amicus' test user (e.g. adding support for different types of users via roles), they were ready to get onboarded and become paying customers! More than 20 people from a single company are using Amicus daily for their work, making it an amazing source of continuous feedback for further development.</p><p>Erlis enjoyed the most how fast he could progress and ship features with Wasp on a weekly basis. Having both front-end, back-end, and database set and fully configured to work together from the beginning, he could focus on developing features rather than spend time figuring out the intricacies of the specific stack.</p><blockquote><p>If it weren't for Wasp, Amicus would probably have never been finished. I estimate it saved me 100+ hours from the start and I'm still amazed that I did all this work as a team-of-one. Being able to quickly change existing features and add the new ones is the biggest advantage of Wasp for me.</p><p>— Erlis Kllogjri - Amicus</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="beyond-mvp-with-wasp">Beyond MVP with Wasp<a href="#beyond-mvp-with-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Beyond MVP with Wasp" title="Direct link to Beyond MVP with Wasp">​</a></h2><p>Although Erlis already has a product running in production, with first paying customers, he wants to see how far he can take it and has a lot of ideas (also requests) for the next features. <em>(Actually, Erlis had a big kanban board with post-its on a wall behind him as we were chatting, dedicated just to Amicus - that was impressive to see!)</em>. </p><p>Some of the most imminent ones are:</p><ul><li>uploading and sharing files between lawyers and clients</li><li>usage logging and analytics</li><li>transactional emails for notifications</li></ul><p>Since under the hood Wasp is generating code in today's mainstream, production-tested technologies such as React, Node.js and PostgreSQL (through Prisma), there aren't any technical limitations to scaling Amicus as it grows and attracts more users.</p><p>Also, given that the <code>wasp build</code> CLI command generates a ready Docker image for the back-end (and static files for the front-end), deployment options are unlimited. Since Heroku is shutting down its free plan, we added guides on how to deploy your project for free on <a href="http://Fly.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fly.io</a> and Railway (freemium).</p><blockquote><p>I was using Wasp while still in Alpha and was impressed how well everything worked, especially given how much stuff I get. I had just a few minor issues and the team responded super quickly on Discord and helped me resolve it.</p><p>— Erlis Kllogjri - Amicus</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

In his free time he enjoys learning about compilers.</p><p>In his previous position at StudentBeans, he experienced the problem of multiple engineering teams competing for the same dev environment (e.g. testing, staging, …). Then he discovered Wasp and decided to do something about it!</p><p>Read on to learn why Michael chose Wasp to build and deploy an internal tool for managing development environments at StudentBeans.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-the-battle-for-the-dev-environment">The problem: the battle for the dev environment<a href="#the-problem-the-battle-for-the-dev-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The problem: the battle for the dev environment" title="Direct link to The problem: the battle for the dev environment">​</a></h2><p>StudentBeans has a microservices-based architecture with multiple environments - test, staging, production, …. The team practices CI/CD and deploys multiple times a day. With such a rapid development speed, it would relatively often happen that multiple engineering teams attempt to claim the same dev environment at the same time. </p><p>There wasn't an easy way for teams to synchronize on who is using which environment and it would eventually lead to unexpected changes, confusion, and prolonged development times.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution-grabbit---claim-and-release-dev-environments-as-you-go">The solution: Grabbit - claim and release dev environments as-you-go<a href="#the-solution-grabbit---claim-and-release-dev-environments-as-you-go" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The solution: Grabbit - claim and release dev environments as-you-go" title="Direct link to The solution: Grabbit - claim and release dev environments as-you-go">​</a></h2><p>After the incident described above repeated for the n-th time, the team got together for a postmortem. They decided their new development process should look like this:</p><ul><li>merge your changes</li><li>claim the environment you want to deploy to (e.g. testing, staging, …)</li><li>deploy your changes</li><li>test your changes</li><li>release the environment once you are done with it so others are able to claim it</li></ul><p>The other requirements were to build the solution in-house to save money and also not to spend more than a few hours on it as they still needed to deliver some important features for the ongoing sprint.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-rapid-prototyping-with-wasp">The power of rapid prototyping with Wasp<a href="#the-power-of-rapid-prototyping-with-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The power of rapid prototyping with Wasp" title="Direct link to The power of rapid prototyping with Wasp">​</a></h2><p>Michael learned about Wasp during its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first HackerNews launch</a> and it immediately caught his eye. Being a programming language enthusiast himself, he immediately understood the value of a DSL approach and how it could drastically simplify the development process, while at the same time not preventing him from using his preferred tech stack (React, Node.js) when needed.</p><p>Also, although Michael had full-stack experience, his primary strength at the time was on the front-end side. Wasp looked like a great way of not having to deal with the tedious back-end setup and wiring (setting up the database, figuring out API, …) and being able to focus on the UX.</p><blockquote><p>When I first learned about Wasp on HN I was really excited about its DSL approach. It was amazing how fast I could get things running with Wasp - I had the first version within an hour! The language is also fairly simple and straightforward and plays well with React &amp; Node.js + it removes a ton of boilerplate.</p><p>— Michael Curry - Grabbit</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="out-of-the-box-deployment">Out-of-the-box deployment<a href="#out-of-the-box-deployment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Out-of-the-box deployment" title="Direct link to Out-of-the-box deployment">​</a></h2><p>Once Michael was satisfied with the first version of Grabbit, and confirmed with the team it fits their desired process, the only thing left to do was to deploy it! It is well known this step can get really complicated, especially if you're not yet well-versed in the sea of config options that usually come with it.</p><p>Wasp CLI comes with a <code>wasp build</code> command that does all the heavy lifting for you - it creates a directory with static front-end files that you can easily deploy to e.g. Netlify, and on the other hand, a Docker image for the back-end. Since Heroku is ending its free plan, our recommendation is to deploy to Fly.io, for which the detailed guide is provided. You can find the <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/deploying" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed deployment instructions here</a>.</p><p>In Michael's case, he deployed Grabbit behind the VPN since it was an internal tool, and this process was made easy by having a ready-to-go Dockerfile.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="from-mvp-to-a-full-fledged-saas-without-a-rewrite">From MVP to a full-fledged SaaS without a rewrite<a href="#from-mvp-to-a-full-fledged-saas-without-a-rewrite" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From MVP to a full-fledged SaaS without a rewrite" title="Direct link to From MVP to a full-fledged SaaS without a rewrite">​</a></h2><p>The presented functionality of Grabbit above is quite simple (create a resource → claim it → release it), and it could have easily been implemented in some no-code tool or, if we really wanted to go simple, with a Trello board. So why use Wasp at all?</p><p>One reason is that developers know and prefer their tools and trust code over the no-code solutions, especially when requirements are still evolving and it is not evident they won't get "stuck" in some closed system. Michael had similar thinking - as he identified this problem at his own company, he realized others must be facing the same issue as well. That is why his plan was to keep improving Grabbit and eventually offer it as a standalone SaaS.</p><p>This is where Wasp comes in - he could develop and deploy an initial version of Grabbit in a matter of hours, but still end up with a platform that he can extend indefinitely through the power of code with his stack of choice, React &amp; Node.js, while also using the npm packages he is using everyday at work.</p><p>Once he starts adding more advanced features, such as multi-user support with authentication, email notifications, and integration with CI/CD, no-code tools won't cut it any more. This way he saved himself and the company from throwing an MVP away and starting everything from scratch (having to learn the new technology and figure out how to set it all up) as the product evolves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Long story short, now it’s possible to do it in Wasp and it’s also super easy and clean!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2078 lines of code across 24 PRs were changed in <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp repo</a> during <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HacktoberFest 2022</a> - the most prominent online event for promoting and celebrating OSS culture. October has been a blast, to say the least, and the most active month in the repo's history.</p><p>This is the story of our journey along with the tips on leveraging Hacktoberfest to get your repo buzzing! 🐝🐝</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-went-the-stats">How it went: the stats<a href="#how-it-went-the-stats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it went: the stats" title="Direct link to How it went: the stats">​</a></h2><p>Let's take a quick look at the charts below (data obtained from <a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSS Insight</a> platform) 👇</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="PR history" src="/img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/pr-history.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">24 contributor PRs in Oct, an all-time high!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Lines of code changes" src="/img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/code-lines-history.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">On the other hand, number of changed LoC isn't that huge</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>While the number of PRs is at an all-time high, the number of updated lines of code is fewer than usual. If we take a look at the distribution of PR sizes in the first chart, we can see that "xs" and "s" PRs are in the majority (20 out of 24).</p><p><strong>This brings us to our first conclusion: first-time contributors start with small steps!</strong> The main benefit here is getting potential contributors interested and familiar with the project, rather than expecting them to jump in and
immediately start implementing the next major feature. Efforts like that require investing time to understand and digest codebase architecture, design decisions and the development process.</p><p>On the other hand, being able to implement and merge any feature, no matter the size, from beginning to the end, and to get your name on the list of contributors of your favourite project is an amazing feeling! That will make your contributors feel like superheroes and motivate them to keep taking on larger and larger chunks, and maybe eventually even join the core team!</p><p><strong>Thus, the second conclusion would be: don’t underestimate the significance of small PRs!</strong> It's not about reducing your backlog, but rather encouraging developers to get engaged with your project in a friendly way.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>To make it easier for your new contributors, you can prepare in advance good issues to get started with - e.g. smaller bugs, docs improvements, fun but isolated problems, etc.</p><p>We added <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>good-first-issue</code></a> label to such issues in Wasp repo, and even added extra context such as <code>no-haskell</code>, <code>webdev</code>, <code>example</code>, <code>docs</code>.</p></div></div><p>With your repo being set, the next question is <em>"How do I get people to pick my project to work on"</em>? Relying solely
on putting "Hacktoberfest" topic on your GitHub repo won't do the trick, not with thousands of other repos doing the same.</p><p>If you want to get noticed, <strong>you need to do marketing. A lot of it. The name of the game here is what you put in is what you get back.</strong> Let's talk about this in more detail.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-thin-line-between-genuine-interactions-and-annoying-self-promotion">A thin line between genuine interactions and annoying self-promotion<a href="#a-thin-line-between-genuine-interactions-and-annoying-self-promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A thin line between genuine interactions and annoying self-promotion" title="Direct link to A thin line between genuine interactions and annoying self-promotion">​</a></h2><p>First and foremost, you'll need to create <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/735" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entry point</a> with all the necessary information for the participants. We opted for a GitHub issue where we categorized Hacktoberfest issues by type, complexity, etc, but it can be anything - a dedicated landing page, Medium/Dev.to article, or whatever works for you. Once you have that, you can start promoting it.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Hacktoberfest entry point - gh issue" src="/img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/hf-gh-entry-point.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Our entry point for Hacktoberfest</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Our marketing strategy consisted of the following:</p><ol><li><p>Tweeting regularly - what's new, interesting issues, ...</p></li><li><p>Writing meaningful Reddit posts about your achievements</p></li><li><p>Hanging out in HacktoberFest <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hacktoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, chatting with others and answering their questions</p></li><li><p>Checking posts with <a href="https://dev.to/t/hacktoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriate</a> <a href="https://medium.com/tag/hacktoberfest2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tags</a> on different blogging websites like Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc. and participating in conversations. </p></li></ol><p>There are plenty of other ways to advertise your project, like joining events or writing articles. Even <a href="https://github.com/dailydotdev/memetoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meme contests</a>. The activities mentioned above worked the best for us. Let’s dive a bit deeper.</p><p>Tweets are pretty obvious - as mentioned, you can share updates on how stuff is going. Tag contributors, inform your followers about available issues and mention those who might be a good fit for tackling them.  </p><p>Reddit is a much more complex beast. You need to avoid clickbait post titles, comply with subreddit rules on self-promotion and try to give meaningful info to the community simultaneously. Take less than you give, and you’re good. </p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="posting on reddit" src="/img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/oss-reddit-post.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">How posting on Reddit feels</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>The Discord server marketing was pretty straightforward. There’s even a dedicated channel for self-promotion. In case you're not talkative much, dropping a link to your project is OK, and that’s it. On the other hand, the server is an excellent platform for discussing Hacktoberfest-related issues, approaches, and ideas. The more you chat, the higher your chances of drawing attention to your project.</p><p>The most engaging but also time consuming activity was commenting on blog posts of other Hacktoberfest participants. <strong>Pretending that you’re interested in the topic only to leave a self-promoting comment will not bring you anywhere - it can only result in your comment being removed</strong>. Make sure to provide value: add more information on the topic of the article, address specific points the author may have missed, or mention how you’ve dealt with the related issue in your project. </p><p>Be consistent and dedicate time to regularly to check new articles and jump into discussions. Share a link to your repo only if it fits into the flow of the conversation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Content marketing in a nutshell" src="/assets/images/content-marketing-in-a-nutshell-2a0f296439c966511b1e9bdcd7805bea.png" width="736" height="532" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?<a href="#was-it-worth-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Was it worth it?" title="Direct link to Was it worth it?">​</a></h2><p>Before joining HacktoberFest as maintainers, we weren’t sure it would be worth the time investment. Our skepticism was reinforced by the following:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xvynx9/hacktoberfest_is_ruining_opensource/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mentions</a> of people submitting trivial PRs just to win the award</p></li><li><p>The fact that we're making a relatively complex project (DSL for developing React + Node.js full-stack web apps with less code) and it might be hard for people to get into it</p></li><li><p>The compiler is written is Haskell, with templates in JavaScript - again, not the very common project setup</p></li></ol><p>Fortunately, none of this turned out to be a problem! We've got 24 valid PRs, both Haskell and non-Haskell, a ton of valuable feedback, and several dozen new users and community members. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wrap-up">Wrap up<a href="#wrap-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wrap up" title="Direct link to Wrap up">​</a></h2><p>Don’t expect magic to happen. HacktoberFest is all about smaller changes and getting community introduced to your project. Be ready to promote your repo genuinely and don’t be afraid to take part in the contest. We hope that helps and wish you the best of luck!</p><p>Remember, HacktoberFest is all about the celebration of open source. Stick to that principle, and you’ll get the results you could only wish for!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ps---thanks-to-our-contributors">P.S. - Thanks to our contributors!<a href="#ps---thanks-to-our-contributors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to P.S. - Thanks to our contributors!" title="Direct link to P.S. - Thanks to our contributors!">​</a></h2><p>Massive shout out to our contributors: <a href="https://twitter.com/ussgarci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ussgarci</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h4r1337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@h4r1337</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/d0m96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@d0m96</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelCoder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@EmmanuelCoder</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gautier_difolco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gautier_difolco</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vaishnav_mk1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vaishnav_mk1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoLight1010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@NeoLight1010</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/abscubix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@abscubix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JFarayola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JFarayola</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Shahx95" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Shahx95</a> and everyone else for making it possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are working on a new web framework that integrates with React &amp; Node.js, and also happens to be a language. As you can probably imagine, it’s not easy to get people to use a new piece of technology, especially while still in Alpha. On the other hand, without users and their feedback, it’s impossible to know what to build.</p><p>That is why we ran Alpha Testing Program for Wasp - here is what we learned and what went both well and wrong along the way.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="twitter DM - shared atp in swag groups" src="/img/atp/swag-groups-twitter.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="of-course-i-know-about-wasp-i-just-havent-come-around-to-trying-it-out-yet">“Of course I know about Wasp!

These were the main reasons:</p><ul><li>having to find 30 mins to go through our <strong>Build a Todo App</strong> tutorial - <em>“I'm busy now, but I’ll do it next week.”</em></li><li>building a bare-bones todo app is not that exciting</li><li>not having an idea what else to build</li><li><em>“the product is still in alpha, so I will bookmark it for later”</em></li></ul><p>These are all obvious and understandable reasons. I must admit, I’m much the same — maybe even worse — when it comes to trying out something new/unproven. It just isn’t a priority, and without a push that will help me overcome all these objections, I usually don’t have an incentive to go through with it.</p><p>Having realised all that, we understood we needed to give people a reason to try Wasp out <strong>now</strong>, because that’s when we needed the feedback, not next week.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="welcome-to-wasp-alpha-testing-program">Welcome to Wasp Alpha Testing Program!<a href="#welcome-to-wasp-alpha-testing-program" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Welcome to Wasp Alpha Testing Program!" title="Direct link to Welcome to Wasp Alpha Testing Program!">​</a></h2><p align="center"></p><figure><img loading="lazy" alt="The team" src="/img/atp/welcome-to-atp-notion.png" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption style="color:#808080">I was having a bit too much fun <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/CLOSED-Welcome-to-Wasp-Alpha-Testing-program-f3a8a350802341abac87fb7831bb1e60" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, but Portal fans will understand.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>We quickly put together an admissions page for alpha testers in Notion (you can see it <a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) and started sharing it around.

It seems that there are a lot of ways to specify an address, some of which are different from what is expected by our post office, resulting in a number of shipments getting returned.</p><p>An ideal solution would be to use a specialized “address” field in a survey that would auto-validate it, but turns out Typeform (which we used) doesn’t have that feature implemented yet, although <a href="https://community.typeform.com/suggestions-feedback-34/address-field-question-type-2950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s been highly requested</a>.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Shipment returned" src="/img/atp/atp-shipment-returned.jpg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Shipment returned email" src="/img/atp/atp-shipment-returned-email.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-non-obvious-benefit-of-alpha-testing-program">The non-obvious benefit of Alpha Testing Program<a href="#the-non-obvious-benefit-of-alpha-testing-program" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The non-obvious benefit of Alpha Testing Program" title="Direct link to The non-obvious benefit of Alpha Testing Program">​</a></h2><p>What went well is that we got a lot of high-quality feedback that steered and fortified our plan for the upcoming Beta release.</p><p>The other big benefit is that we finally solved the <em>“looks cool but i’ll try it out later maybe”</em> problem. Overall, our usage went well up during the program, but even after it ended, the baseline increased significantly. This was the second-order effect we didn’t foresee.</p><p>Our understanding is that once people finally gave it a try, a portion of them felt the value first-hand and decided to keep using it for other projects as well.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Alpha testing program - usage spike" src="/img/atp/atp-usage-spike.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary--going-forward-beta">Summary &amp; going forward: Beta<a href="#summary--going-forward-beta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary &amp; going forward: Beta" title="Direct link to Summary &amp; going forward: Beta">​</a></h2><p>The overall conclusion from our Alpha Testing Program is it was a worthy effort which got us valuable feedback and positively affected the overall usage. Moving forward we’ll try to focus on ensuring more quality feedback and prioritising 1-to-1 communication to make sure we fully understand what bothers Wasp users and what we can improve. It also might be helpful to do testing in smaller batches so we are not overwhelmed with responses and can focus on the individual testers - that’s something we might try out in Beta.</p><p>As mentioned, the next stop is Beta! It comes out on the 27th of November - <a href="/#signup">sign up here</a> to get notified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Full stack devs" src="/img/tailwind-1.png" width="400px" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Wasp is a configuration language (DSL) for building full-stack web apps with less code and best practices that works alongside React and Node.js. We are on a mission to streamline web app development while empowering developers to continue using the power of code and their favorite tools. We are backed by Y Combinator and engineers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Lyft.</em></p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p><p>There are backend devs who can do some frontend, and frontend devs who can do some backend. But the mythical full stack dev is exceedingly rare (or more likely, a lie). Even as someone who falls into the meme category above, we <em>all</em> still need to make websites that <strong>look noice</strong>. This is a place where CSS frameworks can help.</p><p>But which one should you use? According to our <em>extensive research</em>, a statistically-questionable-but-you’re-still-significant-to-us 11 people on Twitter wanted us to add better support for <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind</a>. Which was lucky for us, since we already added it before asking them. 😅</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Twitter voting" src="/img/tailwind-2.png" width="400px" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ok, it wasn’t a huge stretch for us to do so preemptively. Tailwind is one of the most heavily used CSS frameworks out there today and seems to keep growing in popularity. So how do you integrate it into your Wasp apps? Like many things in Wasp, it’s really easy- just drop in two config files into the root of your project and you can then start using it!

We are on a mission to streamline web app development while empowering developers to continue using the power of code and their favorite tools. We are backed by Y Combinator and engineers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Lyft.</em></p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prologue">Prologue<a href="#prologue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prologue" title="Direct link to Prologue">​</a></h2><p>We've all been there. Your app needs to support user authentication with social login, and you must now decide what to do next. Should you eschew the collective experience and wisdom of the crowd and YOLO it by rolling your own, praying you don't get pwned in prod? "Nah, I just ate some week-old sushi and can't take another risk that big anytime soon.", you rightly think.</p><p>Ok, surely you can just use a library, right? Open source software, baby! "Hmm, seems Library X, Y, and Z are all somewhat used, each with their pros/cons, nuances, and integration pain points. Oh wait, there are tutorials for each... but each says how hard they are to correctly set up and use. I scoped this feature for one day, not a one-week hair-pulling adventure (Dang scrum! Who likes it anyways? Oh yeah, PMs do. Dang PMs!)." Ok, something else. You need to brainstorm. <code>You instead start to surf Twitter and see an ad for some unicorn auth startup.</code></p><p>Eureka, you can go with a third-party SaaS offering! "We shouldn't have to pay for a while (I <del>think?</del> hope!), and it's just another dependency, no biggie... #microservices, right?" "But what about outages, data privacy, mapping users between systems, and all that implicit trust you are placing in them?" you think. "What happens when Elon buys them next?" You gasp as if you walked by a Patagonia vest covered in that hot new <em>Burnt Hair</em> cologne.</p><p>"All I want is username and password auth with Google login support, why is that so hard in 2022?!? I miss Basic HTTP auth headers. I think I'll move off the grid and become a woodworker."</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="easy-auth-setup-in-wasp">Easy auth setup in Wasp<a href="#easy-auth-setup-in-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Easy auth setup in Wasp" title="Direct link to Easy auth setup in Wasp">​</a></h2><p>Wasp helps that dev by taking care of the entire auth setup process out of the box. Adding support for username and password auth, plus Google login, is super quick and easy for Wasp apps. We think this makes adding auth fast and convenient, with no external dependencies or frustrating manual configuration. Here’s how it works:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1---add-the-appropriate-models">Step 1 - Add the appropriate models<a href="#step-1---add-the-appropriate-models" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1 - Add the appropriate models" title="Direct link to Step 1 - Add the appropriate models">​</a></h3><p>We need to store user info and the external mapping association for social logins.

In his free time, he enjoys playing poker, chess and <a href="https://www.smudailycampus.com/news/smu-graduate-julian-laneve-wins-100k-grand-prize-from-data-science-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning</a> data science competitions.</p><p>His project, <a href="https://farnance.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farnance</a>, is a SaaS marketplace that allows farmers to transform their production into a digital asset on blockchain. Julian and his team developed Farnance as a part of the London Business School’s annual hackathon <a href="https://hacklbs.devpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackLBS 2021</a>, and ended up as winners among more than 250 participants competing for 6 prizes in total!</p><p>Read on to learn why Julian chose Wasp to develop and deploy Farnance and what parts he enjoyed the most.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="finding-a-perfect-react--nodejs-hackathon-setup">Finding a perfect React &amp; Node.js hackathon setup<a href="#finding-a-perfect-react--nodejs-hackathon-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Finding a perfect React &amp; Node.js hackathon setup" title="Direct link to Finding a perfect React &amp; Node.js hackathon setup">​</a></h2><p>Julian had previous experiences with React and Node.js and loved that he could use JavaScript across the stack, but setting up a new project and making sure it uses all the latest packages (and then also figuring out how to deploy it) was always a pain. Since the hackathon only lasted for two days, he needed a quick way to get started but still have the freedom to use his favourite stack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-one-line-auth-and-no-api-approach">The power of one-line auth and No-API approach<a href="#the-power-of-one-line-auth-and-no-api-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The power of one-line auth and No-API approach" title="Direct link to The power of one-line auth and No-API approach">​</a></h2><p>Julian first learned about Wasp when it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched on HN</a> and decided it would be a perfect tool for his case. The whole app setup, across the full stack, is covered out-of-the-box, simply by typing <code>wasp new farnance</code>, and he is ready to start writing own React &amp; Node.js code.</p><p>Except on the app setup, the team saved a ton of time by not needing to implement the authentication and a typical CRUD API, since it is covered by Wasp as well. They could also deploy everything for free on Heroku and Netlify in just a few steps, which was a perfect fit for a hackathon.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Julian's testimonial on Discord" src="/img/farnance/julian-discord-testimonial.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Farnance is still running and you can <a href="https://farnance.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try it out here</a>!

He decided to go with Google's material-ui for an UI framework which gave his app an instant professional look, although they didn’t have a dedicated designer on the team.</p><p>With all the common web app features (setup, auth, CRUD API) being taken care of by Wasp out-of-the-box they could invest all the time saved in developing and refining their unique features which in the end brought them victory!</p><blockquote><p>I’ve done plenty of hackathons before where I’ve built small SaaS apps, and there’s just so much time wasted setting up common utilities - stuff like user management, databases, routing, etc. Wasp handled all that for me and let me build out our web app in record time</p><p>— Julian LaNeve - Farnance</p></blockquote><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Farnance's dashboard" src="/img/farnance/farnance-dashboard.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Farnance dashboard in action!</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="start-quickly-but-also-scale-without-worries">Start quickly, but also scale without worries<a href="#start-quickly-but-also-scale-without-worries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Start quickly, but also scale without worries" title="Direct link to Start quickly, but also scale without worries">​</a></h2><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Heroku used to offer free apps under certain limits.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wasp is an open-source configuration language for building full-stack web apps that integrates with React &amp; Node.js. We launched first prototype 2 years ago, currently are at 1.9k stars on GitHub and will be releasing Beta in the coming months.</p><p>It was very hard for us to find and be able to learn from early inception stories of successful OSS projects and that's why we want to share what it looked like for Wasp.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1k stars chart" src="/assets/images/1k_gh_stars_chart-0e5c74b7b623d6bdcd6b81f39dde13fc.png" width="810" height="576" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="before-the-stars-is-this-really-a-problem-1-year">Before the stars: Is this really a problem? (1 year)<a href="#before-the-stars-is-this-really-a-problem-1-year" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Before the stars: Is this really a problem? (1 year)" title="Direct link to Before the stars: Is this really a problem? (1 year)">​</a></h2><p>My co-founder and twin brother Martin and I got an initial idea for Wasp in 2018, while developing a web platform for running bioinformatics analysis in the cloud for one London-based startup.</p><p>It was our third or fourth time creating a full-stack app from scratch with the latest &amp; hottest stack. This time, it was React/Node.js; for our previous projects, we went through PHP/Java/Node.js on the back-end and jQuery/Backbone/Angular on the front-end. Because Martin and I felt we were spending a lot of time relearning how to use the latest stack just to build the same features all over again (auth, CRUD, forms, async jobs, etc.), we asked ourselves: <em>Why not abstract these common functionalities in a stack-agnostic, higher-level language (like e.g. SQL does for databases) to never reimplement them again?</em></p><p>Before we jumped into coding, we wanted to make sure this is a problem that actually exists and that we understand it well (enough). In our previous startup we found Customer Development (aka talking to users) extremely helpful, so we decided to do it again for Wasp.</p><p>In a month or so we conducted 25 problem interviews, probing around “What is your biggest challenge with web app development?” After we compiled the results, we identified the following four problems as the most significant ones and decided to focus on them in our v1:</p><ul><li>It is hard to <strong>quickly start</strong> a new web app and make sure <strong>the best practices are being followed</strong>.</li><li>There is a lot of duplication/boilerplate in <strong>managing the state</strong> across front-end, back-end, and the database.</li><li>A lot of <strong>common features are re-implemented</strong> for every new app.</li><li>Developers are overwhelmed by the <strong>increasing tool complexity</strong> and don't want to be responsible for managing it.</li></ul><p>We also clustered the answers we got by topics, so we could dive deeper and identify the areas that got the most attention:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Start and setup of a web app - problems" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/wasp-cust-dev-start-and-setup.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Interviewee problems regarding starting and setting up a new web app.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div>The reason why we stopped at 25 was that the answers started repeating themselves. We felt that we identified the initial patterns and were ready to move on.<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="0-180-️-first-contact-7-months">0-180 ⭐️: First Contact (7 months)<a href="#0-180-️-first-contact-7-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 0-180 ⭐️: First Contact (7 months)" title="Direct link to 0-180 ⭐️: First Contact (7 months)">​</a></h2><p>After confirming and clarifying the problem with other developers, Martin and I felt we finally deserved to do some coding. (Ok, I admit, we had actually already started, but the interviews made us feel better about it 😀). We created a new repo on GitHub and started setting up the tooling &amp; playing around with the concept.</p><p>For the next couple of months, we treated Wasp as a side project/experiment and didn’t do any marketing. However, we were well aware of how crucial external feedback is. So, once we built a very rudimentary code generation functionality, we also created a project page that we could share with others to explain what we’re working on and ask for feedback.</p><p>At that point, we came up with the first “real” name for Wasp - <strong>STIC: Specification To Implementation Compiler</strong>, as the big vision for Wasp was to be a stack-agnostic, specification language from which we could generate the actual code in e.g. React &amp; Node.js or even some other stack.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="STIC - first project page" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/stic-project-page.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Our first page for Wasp! Not the best at explaining what Wasp does, though.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="baby-steps-on-reddit-and-hacker-news">Baby steps on Reddit and Hacker News<a href="#baby-steps-on-reddit-and-hacker-news" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Baby steps on Reddit and Hacker News" title="Direct link to Baby steps on Reddit and Hacker News">​</a></h3><p>Our preferred way of distributing STIC project page was through relevant subreddits - r/webdev, r/coding, r/javascript, r/Haskell, r/ProgrammingLanguages, …. </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/f38h1t/askjs_we_are_developing_a_declarative_dsl_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> was the first Reddit post we’ve ever made about Wasp:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="First Wasp post on Reddit" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/wasp-reddit-first-post.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Our first Reddit post! We managed to get some feedback before we got banned.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>One important thing we learned is that Reddit doesn’t like self-promotion. Sometimes, even if you’re only asking for feedback, the mods (and bots) will see it as self-promo and ban your post. It depends a lot on the mods, though. Reaching out to them and asking for explanation sometimes helps, but not very often. All subreddits have their own rules and guidelines that describe when or how it is OK to post about your project (e.g., /r/webdev has “Showoff Saturdays”), and we tried to follow them as best as we could.</p><p>After Reddit, we also launched on HN. This was our first ever launch there! We scored 20 points and received a few motivating comments:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="First Wasp post on Reddit" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/first-hn-launch.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="listening-to-users">Listening to users<a href="#listening-to-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Listening to users" title="Direct link to Listening to users">​</a></h3><p>Martin and I also followed up with the people we had previously interviewed about their problems in web dev. We showed them STIC project page and asked for comments. From all the feedback we captured, we identified the following issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Developers were not familiar with a term “DSL.”</strong> Almost all of us use a DSL on a daily basis (e.g., SQL, HCL (Terraform), HTML), but it’s not a popular term.</li><li><strong>Developers feared learning a new programming language</strong>. Although our goal was never to replace e.g. Java or Typescript but to make Wasp work alongside it, we discovered that we had failed to communicate it well. Our messaging made developers feel they have to drop all their previous knowledge and start from scratch if they want to use Wasp.</li><li><strong>Nobody could try Wasp yet + there wasn’t any documentation besides the project page</strong>. Our code was public, but we didn’t have a build/distribution system yet. Only a devoted Haskell developer could build it from the source. This made it hard for developers to buy into the high-level vision, as there was nothing they could hold onto. Web frameworks/languages are very “tactile” — it’s hard to judge one without trying it out.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="180-300-️--anybody-can-try-wasp-out--docs--alpha-3-months">180-300 ⭐️ : Anybody can try Wasp out + Docs = Alpha!

(3 months)" title="Direct link to 180-300 ⭐️ : Anybody can try Wasp out + Docs = Alpha! (3 months)">​</a></h2><p>After processing this feedback, we realized that the next step for us was to get Wasp into the condition where developers can easily try it out without needing any extra knowledge or facing the trouble of compiling from the source. That meant polishing things a bit, adding a few crucial features, and writing our first documentation, so that users would know how to use it.</p><p>To write our docs, we picked <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> — an OSS writing platform made by Facebook. We saw several other OSS projects using it for their docs + its ability to import React in your markdown was amazing. Docusaurus gave us a lot of initial structure, design and features (e.g., search), saving us from reinventing the wheel.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="First Wasp docs" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/first-docs.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Martin made sure to add a huge Alpha warning sign :D</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Our M.O. at the time was to focus pretty much exclusively on one thing, either development or community. Since Wasp team consisted of only Martin and me, it was really hard to do multiple things at once. After the docs were out and Wasp was ready to be easily downloaded, we called this version “Alpha” and switched once again into the “community” mode.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="300-570-️--big-break-on-reddit-and-product-hunt-2-months">300-570 ⭐️ : Big break on Reddit and Product Hunt (2 months)<a href="#300-570-️--big-break-on-reddit-and-product-hunt-2-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 300-570 ⭐️ : Big break on Reddit and Product Hunt (2 months)" title="Direct link to 300-570 ⭐️ : Big break on Reddit and Product Hunt (2 months)">​</a></h2><p>Once Alpha was out, we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=matijash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched again on HackerNews</a> and drew a bit of attention (34 upvotes and 3 comments). However, that was little compared to our Reddit launches, where we scored 263 upvotes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/jvv1yg/together_with_my_brother_ive_been_working_on_wasp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/javascript</a> and 365 upvotes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jx5fyg/together_with_my_brother_ive_been_working_on_wasp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/reactjs</a>:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Big break on Reddit" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/reddit-big-break.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">They love me! [insert Tobey Maguire as Spiderman]</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Compared to the volume of attention and feedback we’ve been previously receiving, this was a big surprise for us! Here are some of the changes in messaging that we made for the Reddit launches:</p><ul><li><strong>Put prefix “declarative” in front of the “language”</strong> to convey that it’s not a regular programming language like Python or Javascript but rather something much more lightweight and specialized.</li><li><strong>Emphasized that Wasp is not a standalone language that will replace your current stack</strong> but rather a “glue” between your React &amp; Node.js code, allowing you to keep using your favourite stack.</li><li><strong>Focused on the benefits like “less boilerplate,”</strong> which is a well known pain in web development.</li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Docs made the difference</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Once we added the docs, we noticed a peculiar thing: <strong>developers became much less trigger-happy to criticize the project, especially in a non-constructive way</strong>. Our feeling was the majority of developers who were checking Wasp out still didn’t read the docs in detail (or at all), but the sheer existence of them made them feel there is more content they should go through before passing the final judgment.</p></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="winning-1-product-of-the-day-on-product-hunt">Winning #1 Product of The Day on Product Hunt<a href="#winning-1-product-of-the-day-on-product-hunt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Winning #1 Product of The Day on Product Hunt" title="Direct link to Winning #1 Product of The Day on Product Hunt">​</a></h3><p>After HN and Reddit, we continued with the “Alpha launch” mindset and set ourselves to launch Wasp on Product Hunt. It was our first time ever launching on PH, so we didn’t know what to expect. We googled some advice, did maybe a week of preparation (i.e., wrote the copy, asked a few friends to share their experiences with Wasp once we’re live), and that was it.</p><p>We launched <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp on PH on Dec 6, 2020</a> and it ended up as Product of the day! That gave us a boost in stars and overall traction. Another benefit of PH was that Wasp also ended up in their daily newsletter, which supposedly has over a million subscribers. All this gave us quite a boost and visibility increase.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Product Hunt launch" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/ph-launch.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="570-1000-️--wasp-joins-yc--official-hn-launch-25-months">570-1000 ⭐️ : Wasp joins YC + “Official” HN launch (2.5 months)<a href="#570-1000-️--wasp-joins-yc--official-hn-launch-25-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 570-1000 ⭐️ : Wasp joins YC + “Official” HN launch (2.5 months)" title="Direct link to 570-1000 ⭐️ : Wasp joins YC + “Official” HN launch (2.5 months)">​</a></h2><p>Soon after Product Hunt, Wasp joined Y Combinator for their W21 batch. We had applied two times before and always made it to the interviews, but did not get in. This time, the traction tipped the scales in our favour. (You can read more about our journey to YC <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/02/23/journey-to-ycombinator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</p><p>For the first month of YC, there was a lot of admin and setup work to deal with alongside the regular program. That added a third dimension to our existing two areas of effort. Once we went past that, we could again put more focus on product and community development. </p><p>Our next milestone was to launch Wasp on Hacker News, but this time “officially” as a YC-backed company. <strong>Hacker News provides a lot of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/yli.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good tips</a> on how to successfully launch and 80% of the advice applies even if your product isn’t backed by YC</strong>. I wish I had known about it before. The gist of the advice is to write in a clear and succinct way and to avoid buzzwords, superlatives, and salesy tone above all. Consider HN readers as your peers and explain what you do in a way you would talk to a friend over a drink. It really works that way.</p><p>We went through the several iterations of the text, sweated over how it’s gonna go, and when the day finally came — we launched! It went beyond all our expectations. With 222 points and 79 comments, <strong>our HN launch was one of the most successful launches (#9) out of 300+ companies in the W21 batch.</strong> Many developers and VCs that checked our launch afterwards were surprised how much positive feedback Wasp received, especially given how honest and direct HN audience can be.</p><p><strong>HN launch brought us about 200 stars right away</strong>, and the rest came in the following weeks. As it was February and the YC program was nearing its end, we  needed to shift gears again and focus on fundraising. This put all the other efforts on the back burner. (You can read about our fundraising learnings from 250+ meetings in 98 days <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/11/22/fundraising-learnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) But the interest of the community remained and even without much activity from our side they kept coming and trying Wasp out.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="YC HN launch" src="/img/1000-gh-stars/yc-hn-launch.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-understanding-users--number-of-stars">Conclusion: understanding users &gt; number of stars<a href="#conclusion-understanding-users--number-of-stars" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion: understanding users > number of stars" title="Direct link to Conclusion: understanding users > number of stars">​</a></h2><p>Our primary goal was never to reach X stars, but rather to understand how we can make Wasp more helpful so that developers would want to use it for their projects. As you could read above, even well before we started a repository we made sure to talk to developers and learn about their problems.</p><p>We also kept continually improving how we present Wasp - had we not pivoted our message from <em>“Wasp is a new programming language”</em> to <em>“Wasp is a simple config language that works alongside React &amp; Node.js”</em> we wouldn’t have been where we are today.</p><p>On the other hand, stars have become an unofficial “currency” of GitHub and developers and VCs alike consider it when evaluating a project. They shouldn’t be disregarded and you should make it easy for users who like your product to express their support by starring your repo (like I’m doing right <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), but that should always be a second order of concern.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="good-luck">Good luck!<a href="#good-luck" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Good luck!" title="Direct link to Good luck!">​</a></h2><p>I hope you found this helpful and that we shed some light on how things can look like in the early stages of an OSS project. Also, keep in mind this was our singular experience and that every story is different, so take everything with a grain of salt and pick only what makes sense for you and your product.</p><p>We wish you the best of luck and feel free to reach out if you'll have any questions!</p>]]></content:encoded>

It provides a simple API and a solid number of predefined excuses. A perfect fit for our needs. Let’s define the requirements for the project: </p><ul><li>The app should be able to pull excuses data from a public API. </li><li>Save the ones you liked (and your boss doesn't) to the database for future reference.</li><li>Building an app shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes.</li><li>Use modern web dev technologies (NodeJS + React)</li></ul><p>As a result – we’ll get a simple and fun pet project. You can find the complete codebase <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/590a08bb14284835c9785d416980da61fe9e0db0/examples/tutorials/ItWaspsOnMyMachine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Final result" src="/assets/images/final-excuse-app-0c228a553be0865e245d5e421f86ea27.png" width="996" height="568" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="theres-an-issue-with-the-third-party-library">There’s an issue with the third party library.<a href="#theres-an-issue-with-the-third-party-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to There’s an issue with the third party library." title="Direct link to There’s an issue with the third party library.">​</a></h2><p>Setting up a backbone for the project is the most frustrating part of building any application. </p><p>We are installing dependencies, tying up the back-end and front-end, setting up a database, managing connection strings, and so on. Avoiding this part will save us a ton of time and effort. So let’s find ourselves an excuse to skip the initial project setup.</p><p>Ideally – use a framework that will create a project infrastructure quickly with the best defaults so that we’ll focus on the business logic. A perfect candidate is <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>. It’s an open-source, declarative DSL for building web apps in React and Node.js with no boilerplate</p><p>How it works: developer starts from a single config file that specifies the app architecture. Routes, CRUD API, auth, and so on. Then adds React/Node.js code for the specific business logic. Behind the scenes, Wasp compiler will produce the entire source code of the app - back-end, front-end, deployment template, database migrations and everything else you’ve used to have in any other full-stack app. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Wasp architecture" src="/assets/images/wasp-compilation-6585aca9de412cf27332aa8f21e7da4d.png" width="1525" height="696" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So let’s jump right in.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maybe-somethings-wrong-with-the-environment">Maybe something's wrong with the environment.<a href="#maybe-somethings-wrong-with-the-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Maybe something's wrong with the environment." title="Direct link to Maybe something's wrong with the environment.">​</a></h2><p>Wasp intentionally works with the LTS Node.js version since it guarantees stability and active maintenance.

</p><p>Also, we’ve declared a database entity called <code>Excuse</code>, queries, and action. The <code>Excuse</code> entity consists of the entity’s ID and the text. </p><p><code>Queries</code> are here when we need to fetch/read something, while <code>actions</code> are here when we need to change/update data. Both query and action declaration consists of two lines – a reference to the file that contains implementation and a data model to operate on. You can find more info <a href="/docs/data-model/operations/overview">in the docs</a>. So let’s proceed with queries/actions.</p><p><strong>2) Create two files: “actions.js” and “queries.js” in the <code>src/server</code> folder.</strong></p><div class="language-js

This action will save the text of our excuse to the database. Then let’s create two queries in the <code>queries.js</code> file. First, one <code>getExcuse</code> will call an external API and fetch a new excuse. The second one, named <code>getAllSavedExcuses</code>, will pull all the excuses we’ve saved to our database. </p><p>That’s it! We finished our back-end. 🎉 Now, let’s use those queries/actions on our UI.</p><p><strong>3) Let’s erase everything we had in the <code>MainPage.js</code> file and substitute it with our new

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haskell is a unique and beautiful language that is worth learning, if for nothing else, then just for the concepts it introduces and their potential to expand your view on programming.</p><p>I have been programming in Haskell on and off since 2011 and professionally for the past 2 years, building a <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiler</a>. While in that time Haskell has become much more beginner-friendly, I keep seeing beginners who are overwhelmed by numerous popular options for build tools, installers, introductory educational resources, and similar. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell’s homepage</a> getting a call from the previous decade to give them their UX back :D also doesn’t help!</p><p>That is why I decided to write this opinionated and practical post that will tell you exactly how to get started with Haskell in 2022 in the most standard / common way. Instead of worrying about decisions that you are not equipped to make at the moment (e.g. “what is the best build tool?”), you can focus on enjoying learning Haskell :)!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr--super-opinionated-summary">TLDR / Super opinionated summary<a href="#tldr--super-opinionated-summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TLDR / Super opinionated summary" title="Direct link to TLDR / Super opinionated summary">​</a></h2><ol><li>For setup, use <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GHCup</a>. Install GHC, HLS, and cabal.</li><li>As a build tool, use <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabal</a>.</li><li>For editor, use VS Code with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell extension</a>.

Feel free to ask for help!</li><li>To learn the basics of Haskell, read the <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LYAH</a> book and <a href="https://lhbg-book.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a blog generator in Haskell</a>. Focus on getting through stuff instead of understanding everything fully; you will come back to it later again.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-setup-use-ghcup-for-seamless-installation">1. Setup: Use GHCup for seamless installation<a href="#1-setup-use-ghcup-for-seamless-installation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Setup: Use GHCup for seamless installation" title="Direct link to 1. Setup: Use GHCup for seamless installation">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GHCup</a> is a universal installer for Haskell. It will install everything you need to program in Haskell and will help you manage those installations in the future (update, switch versions, and similar). It is simple to use and works the same way on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It gives you a single central place/method to take care of your Haskell installation so that you don’t have to deal with OS-specific issues.</p><p>To install it, follow instructions at <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GHCup</a>. Then, use it to install the Haskell Toolchain (aka stuff that you need to program in Haskell). </p><p>Haskell Toolchain consists of:</p><ol><li>GHC -&gt; Haskell compiler</li><li>HLS -&gt; Haskell Language Server -&gt; your code editor will use this to provide you with a great experience while editing Haskell code</li><li>cabal -&gt; Haskell build tool -&gt; you will use this to organize your Haskell projects, build them, run them, define dependencies, etc.</li><li>Stack -&gt; cabal alternative, which you won’t need for now since we’ll go with cabal as our build tool of choice</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-build-tool-use-cabal">2. Build tool: Use cabal<a href="#2-build-tool-use-cabal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Build tool: Use cabal" title="Direct link to 2. Build tool: Use cabal">​</a></h2><p>There are two popular build tools for Haskell: <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cabal</a> and <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack</a>. Both are widely used and have their pros and cons. So, one of the hard choices beginners often face is which one to use.</p><p>Some time ago, cabal was somewhat hard to use (complex, “dependency hell”). That’s why Stack was created: a user-friendly build tool that solves some of the common issues of cabal. (Interestingly, Stack uses cabal’s core library as its backend!) However, as Stack was being developed, cabal advanced, too. Many of its issues have been solved, making it a viable choice for beginners.</p><p>In 2022, I recommend <code>cabal</code> to beginners. I find it a bit easier to understand when starting out (no resolvers), it works well out of the box with GHCup and the rest of the ecosystem, and it seems to be better maintained lately. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-editor-vs-code-is-a-safe-bet">3. Editor: VS Code is a safe bet<a href="#3-editor-vs-code-is-a-safe-bet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Editor: VS Code is a safe bet" title="Direct link to 3. Editor: VS Code is a safe bet">​</a></h2><p>HLS (Haskell Language Server) brings all the cool IDE features to your editor. So, as long as your editor has a decent Haskell language extension that utilizes HLS, you are good.</p><p>The safest bet is to go with <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> — it has a great <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell extension</a> that usually works out of the box. A lot of Haskell programmers also use Emacs and Vim. I can confirm they also have good support for Haskell. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-community-rhaskell-and-more">4. Community: r/haskell and more<a href="#4-community-rhaskell-and-more" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Community: r/haskell and more" title="Direct link to 4. Community: r/haskell and more">​</a></h2><p>Haskell community is a great place to ask for help and learn about new developments in the  ecosystem. I prefer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/haskell</a> -&gt; it tracks all the newest events and no question goes unanswered. There is also <a href="https://discourse.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell Discourse</a>, where a lot of discussions happen, including the more official ones. A lot of Haskellers are still active on <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRC</a>, but I find it too complex and outdated to use.</p><p><em>Check <a href="https://www.haskell.org/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.haskell.org/community</a> for a full list of Haskell communities.</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-learning-you-dont-need-a-math-degree-just-grab-a-book">5. Learning: You don’t need a math degree, just grab a book<a href="#5-learning-you-dont-need-a-math-degree-just-grab-a-book" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Learning: You don’t need a math degree, just grab a book" title="Direct link to 5. Learning: You don’t need a math degree, just grab a book">​</a></h2><p>There is a common myth going around that you need a special knowledge of math (PhD in category theory!) to be able to program in Haskell properly. From my experience, this is as far from the truth as it can be. It is certainly not needed, and I seriously doubt it helps even if you have it. Maybe for some very advanced Haskell stuff, but certainly not for junior/intermediate level.</p><p>Instead, learning Haskell is the same as learning other languages -&gt; you need a healthy mix of theory and practice. The main difference is that there will be more unusual/new concepts than you are used to, which will require some additional effort. But these new concepts are also what makes learning Haskell so fun!</p><p>I recommend starting with a book for beginners, <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LYAH</a>. It has an online version that you can read for free, or you can buy a printed version if you like physical books.</p><p>If you don't like LYAH, consider other popular books for beginners (none of them are free though):</p><ol><li><a href="https://haskellbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell Programming from first principles</a></li><li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Programming with Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming in Haskell</a></li></ol><p>Whatever book you go with, don’t get stuck for too long on concepts that are confusing to you, especially towards the end of the book. Some concepts will just need time to click; don’t expect to grasp it all on the first try. Whatever you do grasp from the first read will likely be more than enough to get going with your first projects in Haskell. You can always come back to those complex concepts later and understand them better. Also, don’t be shy to ask the community -&gt; there are many Haskellers out there happy to support you in your learning!</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>When I say "don't get stuck", I don't mean you should skip the difficult concept after the first hurdle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been programming professionally for over a decade, using a variety of languages day-to-day including Ada, C, Java, Ruby, Elixir, and JavaScript. I’ve also tried some obscure ones, albeit less frequently and for different purposes: MIPS assembly language and OCaml for academic work (I’m a BS, MS, and PhD dropout in CS), and Zig for some side projects. In short, I like learning new languages (at least at a surface level) and have been exposed to different programming paradigms, including functional.</p><p>Yet, I have never done Haskell. I’ve wanted to learn it since my college days, but never got the time. In late 2021, though, my curiosity took over. I wanted to see for myself if the mystique and the Kool-Aid hype (or hate) around it are justified. :P So, I decided I’d start learning it on the side and also look for a company that uses it as my next gig. That’s how my Haskell journey started, and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how I got into Wasp</a> a few months later.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-learn-haskell">Why learn Haskell?<a href="#why-learn-haskell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why learn Haskell?" title="Direct link to Why learn Haskell?">​</a></h2><p>Haskell seems to have an aura of superiority around it. Many niche and heavily academically-inspired languages do. These languages seem to be used by the enlightened minds and allow you to quickly write complex programs in a fraction of the time with significantly less code. Lisp is amongst these languages, too. Yet, nobody uses them for anything real — only toy projects. (While stroking their long, grey beards under a tree, ruminating on the philosophy of computer science.) At least, that’s the impression I got in college and at work. So, what makes Haskell interesting to learn, let alone want to use professionally?</p><p><strong>First, it is functional as it gets.</strong> While I have used lambdas and functional concepts like <code>map</code> in non-functional languages, the fact that these were my <em>only</em> choice was really interesting to me. After years of extensive OO usage, I’ve come to appreciate this epigram by Alan Perlis. I think it captures a mindset shift between the two paradigms:</p><blockquote><p>“It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.” — Alan Perlis</p></blockquote><p>In OO, you create lots of classes with lots of methods. In functional, you have far fewer data structures (mostly list) with a lot more functions. So basically more functions to operate on fewer nouns, whereas OO is lots of nouns, each with many bespoke methods. (The first comment on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016271/why-is-it-better-to-have-100-functions-operate-on-one-data-structure-than-10-fun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Stack Overflow thread</a> explains it really well.)</p><p>Besides, I liked the idea of referential transparency when writing pure functions. It means that you get the same result back every time you invoke a function, without fear of unknown side effects. (But the language does offer the flexibility to have side effects like IO, via Monads.) I also liked having only immutable data structures — they make reasoning about the system and data flow easier. There were many things like these two that I liked. The point is that thinking functionally really changes the way you structure and solve problems, so I was curious to give it a go.</p><p><strong>Second, Haskell is lazy.</strong> While there are pros and cons to this, it feels undeniably different. Most languages are strict, in that all function arguments are evaluated before invoking a function. This is required because of side effects; to have some expectations regarding the order in which things will run. Haskell does the opposite: it delays evaluation until it’s actually needed.</p><p>One contrived yet helpful example of laziness is infinite data structures. Below, we define <code>fibs</code> as an infinite <code>List</code> of <code>Integer</code> values, by using references to <em>itself</em>! (You can find a runnable example <a href="https://replit.com/@ShayneCzyzewsk1/LazyHaskellExample?v=1#Main.hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.) </p><div class="language-haskell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-haskell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token hvariable">fibs</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">::</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token constant" style="color:#36acaa">Integer</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token hvariable">fibs</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">0</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token builtin">zipWith</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">+</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">fibs</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token builtin">tail</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">fibs</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token builtin">take</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">10</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">fibs</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic">-- [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>There’s a downside to laziness, too. It makes it harder to reason about performance and resource utilization. But the idea that you can define things in a declarative way but know that they are evaluated only when needed is a pretty eye-opening way to program.</p><p>To sum up: Haskell is functional, lazy, and strongly statically typed. Just the trifecta that gets me out of bed in the morning! :D So, how did I go about learning it?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hello-haskell">Hello Haskell!<a href="#hello-haskell" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hello Haskell!" title="Direct link to Hello Haskell!">​</a></h2><p>I started by reading the canonical Haskell newbie resource, “<em><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a>,</em>” often abbreviated LYAH. It was very entertaining, and I learned a lot from it. At times, I wanted it to get to the point more quickly. Still, despite the amusing images and often lengthy examples, it provided me with a great conceptual foundation. I highly recommend it as your first read — it is a really well-written resource for beginners.</p><p>After I was about 80% done with LYAH, I switched to a more recent but still popular book: “<em><a href="https://haskellbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a></em>.” I liked that it started with fundamentals and then moved to more complex topics, slowly but steadily developing my understanding. It was pretty long, though, and sometimes went too far into the weeds. It also had a tinge of intellectual flexing at certain points. Still, it was a good read. I’d read it again if I were starting over.</p><p>I also tried <a href="https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Haskell course from Google</a>. Despite being brief, it explains the key concepts in a relatively complete way. If videos are your thing, it might be a solid way to get up to speed.</p><p>In short, skimming an intro book to get your foundation solid would be the best bet. I’d also recommend trying out many different online resources when covering more intermediate topics, like Monad Transformers, for example. And don’t worry if it takes a while to start feeling comfortable with things that are pretty specific to Haskell! It just takes some time, and often it is more confusing to derive/deeply understand than to just start using them at first. The understanding will come over time. (Of course, sometimes <a href="https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pictures</a> help!)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup-and-ide-support">Setup and IDE support<a href="#setup-and-ide-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setup and IDE support" title="Direct link to Setup and IDE support">​</a></h2><p>Getting Haskell up and running was surprisingly straightforward, even though I ran it on an M1 MacBook Air, which was considered a pretty new architecture in 2021. Since the entire toolchain was not fully ARM-compatible back then, some of the setup advice required a bit of modification. But that was no big deal: I used <code>ghcup</code>, installed HLS in VS Code, and bam! — I had Haskell up and running. It was a pretty nice experience. </p><p>Some minor downsides I recall:</p><ul><li>There doesn’t seem to be a consensus on which build and package management tool to use, Cabal or Stack. However, unless you’re doing something super specific, it’s not an irreversible decision. At Wasp, we started with Stack but then migrated to Cabal since it better fit our setup and workflows. It was pretty seamless.</li><li>One thing I do miss from other IDEs is breakpoint debugging. Technically, there’s <em>some</em> support for it in Haskell, but I don’t think many use it. Breakpoints and lazy evaluation don’t seem to be BFFs.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="0-60-at-work">0-60 at work<a href="#0-60-at-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 0-60 at work" title="Direct link to 0-60 at work">​</a></h2><p>For someone with experience in several different languages, it is pretty achievable to be able to solve minor bugs/features in Haskell after a few weeks of learning. At least, it was for me. I certainly struggled on best practices and such, and my code reviews involved some Haskell golfing comments for sure :) But I could make it do what I wanted it to do from the functionality perspective. Kudos to the mostly helpful compiler errors (with a bit of practice reading) and the Internet!</p><p>Hopefully, your code base demonstrates established project and Haskell patterns, so you can learn as you poke around, and your early code reviewers are supportive coworkers who can explain things as part of their suggestions. I was quite fortunate in that regard: the Wasp team values teaching and learning, and the codebase uses what is called “Simple Haskell”, which limits the use of excessive language extensions in the hopes to keep the core language and concepts as tight as possible. (Note: there are Haskell experts who view this as a severe limitation of the capabilities of the language, but as a newbie, I was happy they did it.)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-was-the-juice-worth-the-squeeze">So, was the juice worth the squeeze?<a href="#so-was-the-juice-worth-the-squeeze" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So, was the juice worth the squeeze?" title="Direct link to So, was the juice worth the squeeze?">​</a></h2><p>Learning Haskell took considerable time and effort. It was completely different from any language I had used before. Yet, I am very happy I embarked on this journey. Even if you do not intend to get a job using Haskell, I still think learning it is worthwhile just to expand your programming point of view and master functional concepts. And for a select set of project types (like writing a compiler for a full-stack web DSL), I feel it really will make you more productive over time. Give an intro to Haskell tutorial or video a try some weekend and let me know what you think! I’m at shayne at wasp-lang dot dev dot com.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Except for a handful of companies who send people to Mars or develop AGI, most startups don’t seem to offer a good reason to join them. You go to their websites and all you see is vague, baseless, overly generic mission-schmission/values-schvalues HR nonsense that supposedly should turn you into a raving fan of whatever they’re doing and make you hit that “Join” button until their servers crash. Well…</p><p>Some people think that’s because most startups aren’t worth joining. I disagree. This argument generalizes one’s own reasons for joining a startup onto every other human being out there, which is unlikely to be true. I think most startups, no matter how ordinary, <em>do</em> have a reason to join them; <em>a good reason</em>; even <em>many good reasons</em> — they just fail to communicate them well. They’re like a shy nerd on Tinder with an empty bio and no profile pic: a kind, intelligent, and thoughtful human being who, unfortunately, will be ruthlessly swiped left — not because he’s a bad match but because his profile doesn’t show why he’s a good one.</p><p>Visually, this “Tinder profile problem” looks like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates not seeing why to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-1-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, look what would happen if a startup communicated a bit better. Suddenly, our candidates could see a reason to join. If the reason is good, they might even swipe right.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing one reason to join a startup" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-2-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>But most startups have <em>many</em> good reasons to join them. If only they communicated well, the outcome would be something like this:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Illustration of candidates seeing many reasons to join; one candidate already running for it" src="/img/worth-joining/illustration-3-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Now, you’re probably wondering just what exactly those reasons are.</p><p>Here’s a rough list:</p><ol><li>The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it</li><li>The team is great</li><li>The culture is amazing</li><li>The business is doing well</li></ol><p>However, if you just copy this list and paste it on your jobs page, you will accomplish nothing. The candidates will never believe you. What you need to do instead is to <em>supply them with a system of concretes (facts) from which their minds will form these abstract conclusions.</em></p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Instead of declaring that “the founders are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent,” show them how so, like Sarah from Canny does by writing comprehensive year-in-review blog posts for <a href="https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four years in a row</a>.</li><li>Instead of proclaiming that “the founders are humble and can have fun,” show them how so, like Michael from Fibery did by becoming a hero of <a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this hilarious page</a>. (No businessy founder would ever agree to make this public. Michael did.)</li><li>Instead of purporting that “the team is great” or “you’ll work alongside very smart people” (God, I hate that one!), show them who exactly those people are, as PostHog does <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Wasp does <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><p>In the rest of the post, I’ll go through the four broad reasons to join a startup one by one and show real-life examples of communicating them well. In the end, I will explain how these four reasons, communicated well, fuse into two compelling messages that will interest any candidate.</p><p>One last thing. For the sake of clarity and comprehension, I will write in the second person. Instead of saying “candidates would never believe them,” I will say “you would never believe them.” It’s much easier to read and understand.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well"><strong>Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well</strong><a href="#possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well" title="Direct link to possible-reasons-why-your-startup-is-worth-joining-and-how-to-communicate-them-well">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-founders--or-the-founders-are-interesting--fun--smart--human--you-name-it"><strong>1.

In these monthly posts, Michael honestly shares everything that’s going on with Fibery, including the good, the bad, and the ugly: firing people for poor performance, losing important customers, and failing to reach product-market fit. The fact that he’s already written 45 of those (as of Aug 2022) is also telling. And he’s not a native English speaker. If he can do that, why can’t you?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Fibery's Startup Diary blog category" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-startup-diary-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crazy-challenges"><strong>Crazy challenges</strong><a href="#crazy-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to crazy-challenges" title="Direct link to crazy-challenges">​</a></h5><p>Besides writing the Startup Diary, Michael also embarks on crazy challenges like <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/100-posts-about-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing 100 posts about products</a>. Only a passionate, driven person would commit to such a thing. You cannot help but respect him for it. (Before this challenge, he wrote 100 Medium posts in 100 days in 2018.

For example, he despises the gentle, soothing “Oh don’t worry that it didn’t work out; you did such a good work!” approach, which is ubiquitous in the modern startup world. Instead, he states that <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/dissatisfaction-leads-to-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dissatisfaction leads to progress</a>, referring to the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Not quite my tempo”</a> scene from Whiplash. Does that make you like him more than Sarah?</p><p>It depends. If you believe that being soft and balanced is better, you’ll go with Sarah; if you believe that real progress comes only from working yourself to the bone, you’ll go with Michael (or Elon). The important thing is that both founders have their own, unique viewpoints of how things should be done, and that they communicate these viewpoints as-is instead of chopping their legs off to fit the latest Procrustean fad.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry"><strong>In-depth, original blog posts about the industry</strong><a href="#in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry" title="Direct link to in-depth-original-blog-posts-about-the-industry">​</a></h5><p>Some entrepreneurs say that doing a startup is like “jumping off a cliff and building your wings on the way down.” Some of it might be true. But if you want <em>reasonable</em> people to jump with you, you better tell them that you have a degree in engineering and know how to assemble wings in a free fall. Otherwise, the only team you’ll recruit is a suicide squad looking for a splashy hit.</p><p>To communicate his expertise, Michael writes in-depth, original, theoretical posts about the nature of knowledge management and organizational productivity. These posts are gems, both literally and metaphorically. (They’re filed under the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gems category</a> in the <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery blog</a>.)</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-vision-v1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibery.io Vision v.1: Getting Started</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/the-next-wave-of-work-management-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Wave of Work Management Software</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/augmenting-organizational-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmenting Organizational Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="https://fibery.io/blog/use-networks-to-prioritize-product-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use Networks to Prioritize Product Features</a></li></ul><p>After reading these articles, you understand not only that Michael really knows how to build wings while falling off the cliff, but that he has already jumped a few times. (Prior to Fibery, Michael had worked on knowledge management for more than a decade. He also had built a successful project management software, <a href="https://www.apptio.com/products/targetprocess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Targetprocess</a>.) You know that he’s an expert who can be trusted.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Michael writes differently from Sarah, they both leverage what they’re good at. Sarah does not try to produce treatises on software development philosophy, and Michael doesn’t gush out with his personal learnings from building a startup. That, I think, is the right way to do it.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are"><strong>How PostHog communicates who their founders are</strong><a href="#how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are" title="Direct link to how-posthog-communicates-who-their-founders-are">​</a></h4><p>PostHog’s founders James and Tim don’t write 100 posts in 100 days or run a personal Instagram. But they’ve come up with something else to communicate what kind of people they are. And it’s something unique.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="well-written-concise-bio"><strong>Well-written, concise bio</strong><a href="#well-written-concise-bio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to well-written-concise-bio" title="Direct link to well-written-concise-bio">​</a></h5><p>First, both founders have decent <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profiles</a> in the company handbook. These bios are short, clear, and humane. They’re also very specific. Where else have you seen the name of the CEO’s cat?</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins' bio in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-bio-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal-readme-files"><strong>Personal README files</strong><a href="#personal-readme-files" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to personal-readme-files" title="Direct link to personal-readme-files">​</a></h5><p>Second, both James and Tim have an extensive README file (<a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a>, <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a>) on how to work with them. These files give you an insight into their productivity habits, interests, and quirks. In fact, after reading them, you will likely have a better idea of the founders than you’d usually get from working at a company for a month!</p><p>For instance, James’s file has sections like:</p><ul><li><strong>Short bio.</strong> Includes very specific details like: “I tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.”</li><li><strong><em>Very clear</em> areas of responsibility.</strong> No need to wonder what the hell the CEO is doing anymore!</li><li><strong>Quirks.</strong> These are remarkably humble and open-minded, like:<ul><li>“If I haven’t responded to something that you’ve sent me, that’s probably because I’ve read it and don’t feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don’t hear back in a reasonable time frame.”</li><li>“I’m a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.”</li><li>Explaining these quirks is an ingenious move. Besides explaining how to work with James, this section communicates that he’s profoundly self-aware and willing to accept and leverage his weaknesses. These qualities are very rare and incredibly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What I value.</strong> In stark contrast to most HR nonsense, these values are very clear, very specific, and written in English rather than HRese. (I just came up with this term: it means “legalese but for HR.”) Here are two examples:<ul><li>“Proactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn’t have hired you if I didn’t trust you. I’d rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don’t get anything done at all.”</li><li>“Directness impresses me. If you don’t like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.”</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to that, there’s also: How I can help you, How you can help me, My goals until end December 2022 (very specific!), Personal strategy, Execution todo (including “1 bike ride a week”!) and Archived todo.</p><p>In summary, this README page is a gem. I wish more founders had them.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of James Hawkins' README in the PostHog Handbook" src="/img/worth-joining/posthog-james-readme-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are"><strong>How we at Wasp communicate who our founders are</strong><a href="#how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are" title="Direct link to how-we-at-wasp-communicate-who-our-founders-are">​</a></h4><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page"><strong>“Who we are” section of every job description page</strong><a href="#who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page" title="Direct link to who-we-are-section-of-every-job-description-page">​</a></h5><p>Matija and Martin (the founders of Wasp) embedded a concise description of who they are right into each <a href="https://www.notion.so/402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description page</a> in Notion.

Or, even worse, they flood their websites with meaningless HR fluff, which only scares interesting people away. In short, communicating culture well is another low-hanging fruit waiting to be picked.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-canny-communicates-their-culture"><strong>How Canny communicates their culture</strong><a href="#how-canny-communicates-their-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-canny-communicates-their-culture" title="Direct link to how-canny-communicates-their-culture">​</a></h4><p>Canny does an outstanding job at communicating their culture. The primary tool they employ is, once again, their <a href="https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>. (Note how multifunctional it is: founders, expertise, team, and now culture.) The posts in the Founder Stories category convey very well what working at Canny feels like. Here are a few examples.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-work-at-canny-blog-post"><strong>“Why work at Canny” blog post</strong><a href="#why-work-at-canny-blog-post" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-work-at-canny-blog-post" title="Direct link to why-work-at-canny-blog-post">​</a></h5><p>I’ll risk repeating myself, but <a href="https://canny.io/blog/work-at-canny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> so beautifully explains Canny’s culture that I couldn’t resist. It mentions why and how they work remotely, how they do team retreats (with photos and a <a href="https://youtu.be/u4yOS1cuMSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> from Lisbon!), and how they had fun together playing weird Zoom games when travel was not an option due to Covid.</p><p>Pay attention to the imagery. It communicates a lot more information than any lengthy, elaborate description would. Indeed, a picture is often worth a thousand words.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A photo of Canny's two team members hacking in Denver" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-hacking-in-denver-min.jpeg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post"><strong>“Lessons from a year of team retreats” blog post</strong><a href="#lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post" title="Direct link to lessons-from-a-year-of-team-retreats-blog-post">​</a></h5><p>Instead of saying that “team is our priority” or “we invest in our people,” Sarah <a href="https://canny.io/blog/lessons-from-team-retreats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shows</a> what they’ve done to support their team. </p><p>Again, note how specific the imagery is.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A photo from Canny's Lessons from a year of team retreats blog post" src="/img/worth-joining/canny-year-of-retreats-min.jpeg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Interestingly, Sarah’s post isn’t framed as “hey we do many team retreats, we’re awesome, come work for us.” If they wrote that, the reader would feel uneasy. They would sense bragging. That’s why the explicit message in the post is what Canny learned doing team retreats, not that they’ve done many. This explicit message, however, <em>implies</em> that they indeed have done many retreats! It sends a message that Canny cares for their employees without explicitly saying so. This is what true mastery looks like.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post"><strong>“The end of our digital nomad journey” blog post</strong><a href="#the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post" title="Direct link to the-end-of-our-digital-nomad-journey-blog-post">​</a></h5><p>Although <a href="https://canny.io/blog/end-digital-nomad-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a> describes Sarah and Andrew’s personal nomad experience, Sarah managed to reveal Canny’s culture through it.

Because it felt real.</p><p>Here’s a glimpse of what people wrote in the comments:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="A screenshot of Hacker News comments on Fibery's /anxiety page" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-hn-1-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Another screenshot of Hacker News comments on Fibery's /anxiety page" src="/img/worth-joining/fibery-hn-2-min.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="remote-page"><strong>Remote page</strong><a href="#remote-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to remote-page" title="Direct link to remote-page">​</a></h5><p>The second special project Fibery did to communicate their culture is the <a href="https://fibery.io/remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/remote page</a>. It shows what working from home is <em>really</em> like. It’s the funniest thing I’ve ever seen done by a software startup. (Have you ever seen a CEO being licked by a dog?) It also shows how the Fibery team works and even how they use Fibery to build Fibery. Like Canny’s “Lessons from a year of team retreats” blog post, it does so implicitly. A true masterpiece.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="weird-humorous-site"><strong>Weird, humorous site</strong><a href="#weird-humorous-site" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to weird-humorous-site" title="Direct link to weird-humorous-site">​</a></h5><p>Broadly, the whole <a href="https://fibery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site</a> screams that Fibery is a place for misfits, rebels, and trouble makers; the place where such people will be valued and will feel like home; the place built around brutal honesty and spicy humor.</p><p>The “What (non-)customers say” section is worth a mention. Over my nine years in startups, I haven’t seen a site that a) lists <em>bad</em> customer reviews; and b) uses 💩 emoji as a filter. Again, this is telling.

Their primary tool is the <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostHog Handbook</a>, which covers virtually <em>every</em> aspect of what working at PostHog feels like: interviews, onboarding, training, management, communication, and even firing.

PostHog does not merely list their values as meaningless abstractions but supports them with evidence.

As most startups are secretive about how things are going, communicating that things are going <em>somehow</em> — no matter how negligible your progress in contrast to the big guys — becomes quite an advantage. It immediately de-risks the opportunity in the candidate’s eyes. So, if EXPERTISE is about convincing candidates that you know how to build the wings, PROGRESS is about showing them the half-built carcass on your way down.

It’s similar to Michael’s Startup Diary in substance, but has a different style. Wasp style. (Which, again, communicates our culture.)</p><p>Like PostHog’s Story page, Wasp’s monthly updates give candidates a bird’s eye view over everything that’s happened in the past two years.

Wasp really end up transmitting is two powerful messages:</p><ul><li>The company is likely to succeed</li><li>Working there will be awesome</li></ul><p>These two messages are the real answer to “why people should join your company.” The trick, however, and the reason why I wrote this post, is that you can only transmit them indirectly. You can’t say “our founders are great.” You need to provide candidates with many-many facts about the founders, which their minds will then fuse into this abstract conclusion. Ditto for expertise, team, culture, and progress. Eventually, these first-level abstractions will blend into still broader ones: “the company is likely to succeed” and “working there will be awesome.”</p><p>Thus, there’s no single, ultimate answer to “why people should join your company.” There’s only a complex system of concrete, specific units of information from which candidates make the answer themselves. In other words, you can’t teach them why your company is likely to succeed and why working here will be awesome. But you can outline the facts and let them learn for themselves. I hope this post shows how to do that outlining well, and I hope you will apply this knowledge to bring talented people onboard and build great things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Besides saving keystrokes, maybe even more valuable is being able to see what methods/properties are available to us within a current scope. IDE being aware of the project structure and code hierarchy also makes refactoring much easier.</p><p><strong>Although that’s already great, how do we take it to the next level?</strong> Traditional IDE support is based on rules written by humans and if we e.g. wanted to make IDE capable of implementing common functions for us, there would be just too many of them to catalogize and maintain by hand.</p><p>If there was only a way for a computer to analyze all the code we’ve written so far and learn by itself how to autocomplete our code and what to do about humanity in general, instead of us doing all the hard work ...</p><p>Delicious and moist cake aside, we actually have this working! Thanks to the latest advances in machine learning, IDEs can now do some really cool things like proposing the full implementation of a function, based on its name and the accompanying comments:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Copilot example - text sentiment" src="/img/copilot-example-sentiment.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">GitHub Copilot generating a whole function body based on its signature and the comments on top of it.</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>This is pretty amazing!

Let’s just assume all this is sorted out and see what happens next.</p></div></div><p><strong>The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?</strong></p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Devs still need to maintain generated code" src="/img/always-has-been-copilot.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem"></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>Although ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future (and if anyone uses the product, it is), the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.</p><p>Imagine all we had was an assembly language, but IDE completion worked really well for it, and you could say “implement a function that sorts an array, ascending” and it would produce the required code perfectly. Would that still be something you’d like to return to in the future once you need to change your sort to descending 😅&nbsp;? </p><p>In other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="meet-the-big-a---abstraction-">Meet the big A - Abstraction 👆<a href="#meet-the-big-a---abstraction-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Meet the big A - Abstraction 👆" title="Direct link to Meet the big A - Abstraction 👆">​</a></h2><p>If Github Copilot and others cannot solve all our troubles of learning how to code and understanding in detail how session management via JWT works, what can? </p><p>Abstraction - that’s how programmers have been dealing with the code repetition and reducing complexity for decades - by creating libraries, frameworks, and languages. It is how we advanced from vanilla JS and direct DOM manipulation to jQuery and finally to UI libraries such as React and Vue.</p><p>Introducing abstractions inevitably means giving up on a certain amount of power and flexibility (e.g. when summing numbers in Python you don’t get to exactly specify which CPU registers are going to be used for it), but the point is that, if done right, you don’t need nor want such power in the majority of the cases.</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Abstraction equals less responsibility" src="/img/uncle-ben-great-power.jpg"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">What Uncle Ben actually meant: avoiding responsibility is the main benefit of abstraction! (Peter totally missed the point, unfortunately, and became Spiderman instead of learning how to code)</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p><strong>The only way not to be responsible for a piece of code is that it doesn’t exist in the first place</strong>. </p><p>Because as soon as pixels on the screen change their color it’s something you have to worry about, and that is why the main benefit of all frameworks, languages, etc. is <em>less code</em> == <em>less decisions</em> == <em>less responsibility.</em></p><p>The only way to have less code is to make less decisions and provide fewer details to the computer on how to do a certain task - ideally, we’d just state what we want and we wouldn’t even care about how it is done, as long as it’s within the time/memory/cost boundaries we have (so we might need to state those as well).</p><p>Let’s take a look at the very common (and everyone’s favorite) feature in the world of web apps - authentication (yaay ☠️&nbsp;🔫)!

it is the responsibility we trust with the authors and maintainers of the abstraction layer, just like we trust that Python knows the best how to sum two numbers on the assembly level and that it is kept in sync with the latest advancements in the field. The same happens when we rely on the built-in data structures or count on the garbage collector to manage our program’s memory well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-my-beautiful-generated-codez--what-happens-with-it-then">But my beautiful generated codez 😿💻!

The main point to understand here is that ML code generation and framework/language development complement rather than replace each other and are here to stay, which is ultimately a huge win for the developer community - they will keep making our lives easier and allow us to do more fun stuff (instead of implementing auth or CRUD API for the n-th time)!</p><p>I see the evolution here as a cycle (or an upward spiral in fact, but that’s beyond my drawing capabilities):</p><ol><li><strong>language/framework exists</strong>, is mainstream, and a lot of people use it</li><li><strong>patterns start emerging</strong> (e.g. implementing auth, or making an API call) → ML captures them, offers via autocomplete</li><li><strong>some of those patterns mature</strong> and become stable → candidates for abstraction</li><li><strong>new, more abstract, language/framework</strong> emerges</li><li><strong>back to step 1</strong>.</li></ol><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Language evolution lifecycle" src="/img/language-lifecycle-copilot.png"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">It’s the circle of (language) life, and it moves us all - Ingonyama nengw' enamabala, …</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>This means we are winning on both sides - when the language is mainstream we can benefit from ML code generation, helping us write the code faster.

We are on a mission to streamline web app development while empowering developers to continue using the power of code and their favorite tools. We are backed by Y Combinator and engineers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Lyft.</em></p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="storytime"><strong>Storytime</strong><a href="#storytime" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to storytime" title="Direct link to storytime">​</a></h2><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Storytime" src="/img/jobs-storytime.gif" width="300px" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Imagine you are working on the next unicorn SaaS web app and need to send a user an email, manipulate an uploaded image via an external API call, or recalculate some internal metrics every night. (Or, maybe you’re doing some fancy blockchain thing for that frothy investment multiple; :D whatever it is, just envision an operation that may take a significant amount of time and/or fail.) How would you implement this?</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Spinning!" src="/img/jobs-spinner.gif" width="30px" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You wouldn’t want the server to delay sending its HTTP response until those are done (unless you are one of those people who love seeing the Mac spinning icon), so you'll need something out-of-band from the normal request-response flow. Even in an event-loop-based system like Node.js, just calling an async function isn't ideal since you will need to handle failures, retries, and throttling, amongst other concerns. And sometimes we need to schedule tasks to run in the future, or repeatedly, so we need a completely different toolset.</p><p>The typical solution here is to use a job queue of some kind. They are not impossible to set up, of course, but there is a fair amount of boilerplate involved, some operational expertise/overhead required, and moving from one system to another when you outgrow it is usually a challenge. These are the exact areas where we feel Wasp can provide real value, so we are happy to introduce Wasp Jobs to help out with this!</p><div class="language-js codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

that gathers GitHub metrics and stores them in the DB) and have it run within the context of a job queue system, which we call an executor. You can manually submit work to be done on the server, or specify a cron schedule to have your job automatically invoked. And, best of all, as we add more job executors in the future, you can change where it runs on a single line in your .wasp file.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="most-jobs-have-a-boss-our-first-job-executor-is-a-pg-boss-">Most jobs have a boss.

Ok, ok, I’ll quit. Ahhh!</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>In my prior life as a Ruby on Rails developer, the decision of how to implement jobs was pretty simple. You had Active Job at your disposal, and for backends, you would use something like Sidekiq or Delayed Job. In a similarly paved path, Python developers would have likely looked first to Celery.</p><p>In the JavaScript world, <a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bull</a> is quite popular these days. However, we decided to use <a href="https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg-boss</a>, as it too provides persistence, delayed jobs, and schedules (plus many other features). But critically, pg-boss uses PostgreSQL instead of Redis (like Bull) for storage and coordination, and this was important since we did not want to introduce any new infrastructure dependencies to our existing production stack.</p><p>But isn’t a database as a queue an anti-pattern, you may ask? Well, historically I’d probably say yes. However, PostgreSQL 9.5 added SKIP LOCKED, which it specifically mentions can aid in avoiding lock contention with multiple consumer queue-like workloads [<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE</a>]. So for the low-volume background job workloads that many apps have, we feel using a database as a queue is a great compromise and starting point for many users from a benefit vs. complexity perspective.</p><p>However, we will also continue to expand the number of job execution runtimes we support. Let us know in <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> what you’d like to see next!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="real-example---updating-waspleau">Real Example - Updating Waspleau<a href="#real-example---updating-waspleau" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Real Example - Updating Waspleau" title="Direct link to Real Example - Updating Waspleau">​</a></h2><p>If you are a regular reader of this blog (thank you, you deserve a raise! 😊), you may recall we created an example app of a metrics dashboard called <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/01/27/waspleau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waspleau</a> that used workers in the background to make periodic HTTP calls for data. In that example, we didn’t yet have access to recurring jobs in Wasp, so we used Bull for scheduled jobs instead. To set up our queue-related logic we had to have this huge <code>setupFn</code> wiring it all up; but now, we can remove all that code and simply use jobs instead!

There are always issues with the SDK/packages/compiler, etc.<br></li><li><strong>building project backbone</strong> (folder structure, basic services, CRUD APIs, and so on).</li></ol><p>Both of them are time-consuming, boring, and cause issues.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dealing with routine might be frustrating" src="/assets/images/I-quit-76ab96fc267251d26680dc4cc951bc92.gif" width="245" height="245" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Thankfully, those issues can be avoided! Gitpod allows you to spin up a clean, already pre-set dev environment. And Wasp enables you to build a full-stack JS web app with a single config file (alongside your React and Node.js code). But first things first.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Pennywise luring into his openspace" src="/assets/images/hackathon-pennywise-066278ed7fc85a89844a02906013d8f6.jpg" width="800" height="469" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dev-environment-setup">Dev environment setup:<a href="#dev-environment-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dev environment setup:" title="Direct link to Dev environment setup:">​</a></h2><p>Gitpod spins up a bespoke dev environment in the cloud for any git branch (once you configured it for your project), on-demand. So you can start coding right away. Build, debug, commit and push your code in seconds, without any local SDK issues. After you’ve finished – you can host your app after a couple of clicks and share the project with your teammate. You can even make changes to the same project simultaneously, leveraging a pair programming approach.</p><p>Since Gitpod is a cloud-based workspace – spinning up a new application takes a couple of clicks.</p><ol><li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-wasp</a> and give it a meaningful name, e.g. “My Awesome Recipes App” -&gt; this is now a repo for your new web app.<br></li><li>In your newly created repo, check the Readme and click the “Open in Gitpod” button<br></li><li>Login via Github<br></li><li>Allow pop-ups<br></li><li>That’s it! Enjoy your fresh cloud-based dev environment!<br></li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Pennywise luring to take part in hackathon" src="/assets/images/gitpod-roadmap-783e3cd78a719cb0ae646d6adf6be554.png" width="6850" height="11234" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>An optional thing might be enabling the “Share” option to make the app accessible from the external internet.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="How to share a workspace" src="/assets/images/gitpod-share-d74408863ed341712358ab6aea434a53.jpg" width="765" height="722" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can pick up one of the following IDE’s, switch between light/dark themes and you can even install all your favorite extensions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Gitpod IDE types" src="/assets/images/gitpod-ide-b80c25e069cbb361cdf86c10ffdbf6ff.jpg" width="879" height="594" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So, eventually, the workflow can look like this: someone from the team forks the template repo and shares it with others. Teammates open this repo in Gitpod, creating their own dev branches.</p><p>Voila! 🥳</p><p>The whole team is ready to code in a matter of seconds. After the team is done with the development, someone can pull all the changes, share the project, and present it to the judges.</p><p>No need to fix local issues, ensure the Node version is aligned, or configure the deployment pipeline for DigitalOcean. Gitpod does all development preparations. The only thing the team has to do – is to implement the idea ASAP. And here Wasp comes into play!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-project-backbone">Building project backbone:<a href="#building-project-backbone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building project backbone:" title="Direct link to Building project backbone:">​</a></h2><p>Ok, we’ve successfully set up a shared dev environment. It’s time to create a production-ready web app with just a few lines of code. Based on your needs – you can declare separate pages, routes, database models, etc. - it’s super easy and intuitive!</p><p>The ideal case would be to:<br></p><ol><li>Check out the language overview: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/general/language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/general/language</a> <br></li><li>Follow a 20-minutes tutorial on how to build a To-Do app with Wasp: <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorial/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorial/create</a> <br></li></ol><p>It may seem a bit inconvenient: why spend time on learning, when you already can start building something meaningful? The short answer is: time-saving. Wasp’s main point is to set you free from building time-consuming boilerplate. So even if you’ll spend half of an hour learning the basics – you’ll still be able to outrun other hackathon participants. While they will be copy-pasting CRUD API methods – you’ll be building business logic.</p><p>And 20 minutes is time well spent to become more productive. Setting up each team member's environment locally likely takes more than 20 minutes if you don't use Gitpod.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="to-wrap-up">To wrap up:<a href="#to-wrap-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to To wrap up:" title="Direct link to To wrap up:">​</a></h2><p>We think that Wasp + Gitpod is a powerful toolset for speedrunning any hackathon. No matter how complex or ambitious your project is. If it’s built with Node and React – nothing can stop you from winning. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy that pizza 🍕!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Engineer!</strong> Filip is an experienced engineer and a passionate computer
scientist - his two biggest passions are building compilers/designing
programming languages and web development (what a lucky coincidence, right?
;)). Before joining Wasp, Filip earned his stripes in various domains, ranging
from bioinformatics and the betting industry to route optimisation software.
Welcome to the team, Filip - we can't wait to see what you build!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lets-start-with-two-truths-and-a-lie-about-yourself">Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself.<a href="#lets-start-with-two-truths-and-a-lie-about-yourself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself." title="Direct link to Let’s start with two truths and a lie about yourself.">​</a></h4><ul><li>I found out about Wasp through a friend/former colleague and still haven’t
bought him a drink to say thanks.</li><li>I’ve designed and implemented my own Turing-complete functional programming
language that compiles to JavaScript.</li><li>I wasted nearly 30 hours customizing my setup to maximize productivity and
probably ended up in a less productive state.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="which-statement-was-the-lie-above-any-interesting-stories-to-share">Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?<a href="#which-statement-was-the-lie-above-any-interesting-stories-to-share" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?" title="Direct link to Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?">​</a></h4><p>The last one was a lie. I wish it were only 30 hours :)</p><p>I did design <a href="https://sodic.github.io/func" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a programming language</a>. It is
Turing-complete but still far from being practical. For one, it can’t print
stuff to the screen (or perform any other side effects).</p><p>I never did buy that drink. He’s not letting me forget about it, though.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-you-join-wasp-what-did-you-do-before">Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?<a href="#why-did-you-join-wasp-what-did-you-do-before" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?" title="Direct link to Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?">​</a></h4><p>I've wanted to work on a project where I'd get a chance to design a language
and build a compiler for quite some time now. While I did develop my own
language on the side (and even graduated with it), I thought getting paid for
doing something similar this early in my career was pretty far-fetched.</p><p>Almost all my paid work had something to do with the web, whether on the
client-side or the server-side. I enjoy nearly all parts of web development
(yes, even styling websites with CSS :), but one thing I've always found
annoying was dealing with all the boilerplate. Whenever I start building
something, I spend most of my time implementing the same repetitive stuff
(e.g., authentication, databases, SPA routing, API routes, etc.) and relearning
all the best practices that come with it.</p><p>And then, one day, a friend of mine mentioned Wasp - a DSL aiming to eliminate
boilerplate from web apps. The product was a perfect fit based on everything I
know and want to do! Also, I shared a college advisor with the founders (Martin
and Matija) and only heard great things about them.</p><p>The whole thing sounded almost too good to be true, so joining them to work on
Wasp was an easy decision.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-favorite-language">What is your favorite language?<a href="#what-is-your-favorite-language" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is your favorite language?" title="Direct link to What is your favorite language?">​</a></h4><p>I don’t have many favorite things, especially when it comes to technology.
After going through several cycles of falling in love with a
language/framework/tool before becoming annoyed by its shortcomings and
limitations, I made peace with the fact that everything’s a tradeoff. I’ll
generally choose a language depending on:</p><ul><li>the problem at hand</li><li>its current position in the aforementioned cycle :)</li></ul><p>With that said, I'm currently most excited about properly learning Haskell. It
always looked interesting and exotic. I've gotten a few opportunities to play
with the language through university courses and on my own but never really had
an excuse to use it in my day-to-day.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp">What are you most excited about in Wasp?<a href="#what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?" title="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?">​</a></h4><p>From a developer’s perspective, I’m definitely most excited about designing the
DSL and working on the compiler.</p><p>From a product standpoint, I love the idea of never again having to implement
an authentication system.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-a-feature-or-project-youre-most-proud-of-that-you-worked-on-in-the-past-three-months">What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?<a href="#whats-a-feature-or-project-youre-most-proud-of-that-you-worked-on-in-the-past-three-months" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?" title="Direct link to What’s a feature or project you’re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?">​</a></h4><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Definitely this thing</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-start-coding">How did you start coding?<a href="#how-did-you-start-coding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did you start coding?" title="Direct link to How did you start coding?">​</a></h4><p>No exciting story to tell here, I’m afraid.</p><p>I enrolled in computer science college and first started programming as a part
of my regular “Introduction to programming” course.</p><p>Before then, I didn’t really know what programming was. In fact, I  wanted to
study electrical engineering. Unluckily for most but luckily for me, our
college does not let you choose your major (i.e., electrical engineering or
computing) right away. Instead, they make you go through a shared year of
universal (and some not-so-universal) courses, only allowing you to specialize
at the start of your second year. Thanks to this quirk, I had a chance to
encounter programming, change my mind, and enroll in computer science.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-dev-setup">Your dev setup?<a href="#your-dev-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your dev setup?" title="Direct link to Your dev setup?">​</a></h4><p>As far as hardware goes, it’s pretty basic. I use a regular laptop that’s
starting to show signs of age (ASUS N550JX), a cheap Lenovo mouse, and my
laptop’s integrated keyboard.</p><p>The software setup is a bit more interesting. I’m usually on Manjaro Linux with
the i3 tiling window manager. I jump between editors depending on what I’m
doing. It’s sometimes Vim, but mainly something more powerful that comes with
Vim emulation (e.g., VS Code or JetBrains IDEs). My preferred shell is zsh
(sorry Frane).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="camelcase-or-snake_case"><code>camelCase</code> or <code>snake_case</code>?<a href="#camelcase-or-snake_case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to camelcase-or-snake_case" title="Direct link to camelcase-or-snake_case">​</a></h4><p>NoPreference</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-current-favorite-gem-library-tool-or-anything-else-that-helps-you-with-your-work-why">What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work?

Why?" title="Direct link to What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work? Why?">​</a></h4><p>That would have to be <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranger</a>!</p><p>Ranger is a terminal file manager I use daily, mainly because it makes my work
in the shell much faster. It also gives me a consistent interface for moving
around, previewing files, and interacting with the file system. In other words,
my workflow doesn't have to change much regardless of where I am (Mac, Linux
Desktop, or Linux server).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-budding-developers">One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?<a href="#one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-budding-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?" title="Direct link to One piece of advice you’d give to budding developers?">​</a></h4><p>It’s easy to get stuck in an endless loop of polishing and fine-tuning your
projects because you think they aren’t ready yet. Good enough sometimes truly
is good enough and things can often be considered done before <em>you</em> consider
them done.</p><p>I still occasionally need to give this advice to myself :).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lastly-where-can-people-find-or-connect-with-you-online">Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?<a href="#lastly-where-can-people-find-or-connect-with-you-online" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?" title="Direct link to Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?">​</a></h4><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sodic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/sodic</a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipsodic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipsodic/</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

Wouldn’t it be great if there was a quick and easy way to build a nice-looking metrics dashboard from data pulled in by HTTP calls to many different sources, cache the data in-memory, and periodically update it via background jobs?

The technology, problem space, and team were just too compelling to pass up. I was also excited to be on the ground floor of a YC startup, where I can have a significant impact and help build a broad, welcoming, open-source community of Wasp developers.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-you-do-before">What did you do before?<a href="#what-did-you-do-before" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did you do before?" title="Direct link to What did you do before?">​</a></h4><p>I have been a professional developer for over a decade, mostly in backend web development, with experience from Lockheed Martin, Morgan Stanley, NetApp, and Red Hat. Most recently, I was the head of engineering at an edtech company called LearnPlatform, where we were handling a quarter of a billion incoming events per day with the goal of understanding and improving student access to technology that works best for them.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-favorite-languageframework">What is your favorite language/framework?<a href="#what-is-your-favorite-languageframework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is your favorite language/framework?" title="Direct link to What is your favorite language/framework?">​</a></h4><p>My favorite framework is probably Ruby on Rails, for the elegance of ideas and seamless implementation. I never had an actual favorite programming language, as I enjoy different aspects of Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, C#, and others. My least favorite has always been Java. My current favorite language is fast becoming Haskell. :)</p><p>The most interesting niche programming language I have used professionally was Ada at Lockheed Martin. We used it to build distributed, real-time, full-motion flight simulators for the military (think multi-million dollar, hyperrealistic multiplayer video games).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp">What are you most excited about in Wasp?<a href="#what-are-you-most-excited-about-in-wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?" title="Direct link to What are you most excited about in Wasp?">​</a></h4><p>As web developers, I think we have gotten accustomed to a certain level of complexity that is not associated with the problem we are solving but the boilerplate of the process. This lack of nuance between accidental and essential complexity has recently led to less than ideal low-code approaches. Wasp, in my view, takes the better approach of a higher-level DSL to abstract some of the typical details using best practices, leaving you to focus on your problem by writing actual code that produces a real web app without any vendor lock-in. That is pretty amazing to me!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-did-you-start-coding">How did you start coding?<a href="#how-did-you-start-coding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How did you start coding?" title="Direct link to How did you start coding?">​</a></h4><p>Probably by creating some basic LAMP apps in the late 90s while in high school. Growing up, our parents wanted us to have summer jobs to earn money we could spend during the rest of the year. I quickly found that freelance web development on Elance, and similar sites, was more enjoyable and profitable than the alternatives available to 15-year-olds. From then on, I was hooked.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-your-dev-setup">What is your dev setup?<a href="#what-is-your-dev-setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is your dev setup?" title="Direct link to What is your dev setup?">​</a></h4><p>MacBook Air M1 with an external Dell display, Magic Trackpad, and a split mechanical keyboard from UHK (Ultimate Hacking Keyboard).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="camelcase-or-snake_case"><code>camelCase</code> or <code>snake_case</code>?<a href="#camelcase-or-snake_case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to camelcase-or-snake_case" title="Direct link to camelcase-or-snake_case">​</a></h4><p>I default to whatever the language or codebase conventions are. Visually, I prefer snake case, though (and definitely spaces over tabs). ;)</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-an-aspiring-developer">What's one piece of advice you'd give to an aspiring developer?<a href="#whats-one-piece-of-advice-youd-give-to-an-aspiring-developer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's one piece of advice you'd give to an aspiring developer?" title="Direct link to What's one piece of advice you'd give to an aspiring developer?">​</a></h4><p>One of the biggest differentiators I have found between good and great engineers is that the great ones possess a continuous desire to learn and grow. They view challenges as fun opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills, recognizing that they always have room for improvement. The corollary is that impostor syndrome is real and never goes away, so try not to be too hard on yourself along the way!</p><p><em>This post was the first of several new hire announcements in the months to come, so stay tuned and reach out if you want to work with Martin, Shayne, and myself!</em></p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

This is why Trello was a great choice of app to build with Wasp - it is one of the most well-known full-stack web apps, it's very simple and intuitive to use  but also covers a good portion of features used by today's modern web apps.</p><p>So let's dig in and see and how it went - what works, what doesn't and, what's missing/coming next!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"

basic functionality is here - Waspello users can signup/log in which brings them to their project board where they can perform CRUD operations on lists and cards - create them, edit them, move them around, etc. Let's see it in action:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Waspello in action" src="/assets/images/waspello-in-action-6ba87b72af0af99a4c4acb9adf0cf3bb.gif" width="1682" height="954"

we'll examine why is that so a bit later.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="under-the-hood--">Under the hood 🚘 🔧<a href="#under-the-hood--" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct

class="image-caption">Waspello code anatomy</p><p>Let's now dig in a bit deeper and shortly examine each of the concepts Wasp supports (page, query, entity, ...) and learn through code samples how to

to <strong>do a lot of heavy lifting for us - e.g. it will make the query available to the client without any extra code</strong>, all that developer needs to do is import it in their React component.

or action as described above, you can immediately import it into your client code as shown in the code sample, by using the <code>@wasp</code> prefix in the import path. <code>useQuery</code> ensures reactivity so once the data changes the query will get re-fetched. You can find more details about it <a href="/docs/data-model/operations/queries#the-usequery-hook-1">here</a>.</p><p>This is pretty much it from the stuff that works 😄 ! I kinda rushed a bit through things here - for more details on all Wasp features and to build your first app with Wasp, check out our <a href="/docs">docs</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-doesnt-work-yet">What doesn't work (yet)<a href="#what-doesnt-work-yet" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What doesn't work (yet)" title="Direct link to What doesn't work (yet)">​</a></h2><p>The main problem of the current implementation of Waspello is the <strong>lack of support for optimistic UI updates in Wasp</strong>. What this means is that currently, when an entity-related change is made (e.g. a card is moved from one list to another), we have to wait until that change is fully executed on the server until it is visible in the UI, which causes a noticeable delay.<br>
<!-- -->In many cases that is not an issue, but when UI elements are all visible at once and it is expected from them to be updated immediately, then it is noticeable. This is also one of the main reasons why we chose to work on Waspello - to have a benchmark/sandbox for this feature! Due to this issue, here's how things currently look like:</p><div><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Waspello - no optimistic UI update" src="/img/waspello-no-opt-UI-updates.gif"><figcaption class="image-caption" style="font-style:italic;opacity:0.6;font-size:0.9rem">Without an optimistic UI update, there is a delay</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><p>You can notice the delay between the moment the card is dropped on the "Done" list and the moment it becomes a part of that list. The reason is that at the moment of dropping the card on "Done" list, the API request with the change is sent to the server, and only when that change is fully processed on the server and saved to the database, the query <code>getListsAndCards</code> returns the correct info and consequently, UI is updated to the correct state.<br>
<!-- -->That is why upon dropping on "Done", the card first goes back to the original list (because the change is not saved in db yet, so <code>useQuery(getListsAndCards)</code> still returns the "old" state), it waits a bit until the API request is processed successfully, and just then the change gets reflected in the UI.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-solution">The solution<a href="#the-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The solution" title="Direct link to The solution">​</a></h4><p>A typical approach for solving this issue is to <strong>make the client a bit more self-confident, in a way that it doesn't wait for the confirmation from the server but rather immediately updates the UI, at the same time or even before the API request is fired</strong>. If it then turns out something went wrong on the server (which typically shouldn't happen), it reverses the change and shows an error message. Thus the name optimistic UI update, since the client assumes in advance that everything will go well to provide a nicer UX.</p><p align="center"></p><figure><img loading="lazy" alt="Waspello - the client being brave" src="/img/waspello-client-being-brave.gif" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption class="image-caption">The client when performing an optimistic UI update</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>This is one of the most complex and error-prone features when developing web apps today and that is why we are super excited to tackle it in Wasp and make the experience as smooth as possible! We are currently in the "figuring out the solution" stage and you can <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track/join the discussion on GitHub</a>!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-missing-next-features">What's missing (next features)<a href="#whats-missing-next-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's missing (next features)" title="Direct link to What's missing (next features)">​</a></h2><p>Although it looks super simple at the first glance, Trello is in fact a huge app with lots and lots of cool features hidden under the surface! Here are some of the more obvious ones that are currently not supported in Waspello:</p><ul><li><strong>Users can have multiple boards</strong>, for different projects (currently we have no notion of a "Board" entity in Waspello at all, so there is implicitly only one)</li><li><strong>Detailed card view</strong> - when clicked on a card, a "full" view with extra options opens</li><li><strong>Search</strong> - user can search for a specific list/card</li><li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - multiple users can participate on the same board</li></ul><p>And many more - e.g. support for workspaces (next level of the hierarchy, a collection of boards), card labels, filters, ... . It is very helpful to have such a variety of features since we can use it as a testing ground for Wasp and use it as a guiding star towards Beta/1.0!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="become-a-waspeller">Become a Waspeller!<a href="#become-a-waspeller" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Become a Waspeller!" title="Direct link to Become a Waspeller!">​</a></h2><p align="center"></p><figure style="width:55%"><img loading="lazy" alt="Waspello propaganda" src="/img/waspello-propaganda.png" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption class="image-caption">Lightweight Waspello propaganda</figcaption></figure><p></p><p> If you want to get involved with OSS and at the same time familiarize yourself with Wasp, this is a great way to get started - feel free to <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose one of the features listed here or add your own</a> and help us make Waspello the best demo productivity app out there!</p><p>Also, make sure to <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our community on Discord</a>.

<img loading="lazy" alt="Wasp fundraise chart" src="/assets/images/wasp-fundraise-chart-a33933a8d730d069466d786cdd899558.png" width="1200" height="742" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Here are some of the things that worked for us:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-treated-fundraising-as-a-sales-process-and-stuck-to-it">We treated fundraising as a sales process (and stuck to it)<a href="#we-treated-fundraising-as-a-sales-process-and-stuck-to-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We treated fundraising as a sales process (and stuck to it)" title="Direct link to We treated fundraising as a sales process (and stuck to it)">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Wasp fundraise funnel" src="/assets/images/wasp-fundraise-funnel-bbf1b2a80cd7af81c9e3c6790b4a0541.png" width="838" height="74" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This means we had a typical sales funnel - lead generation, selling (pitching) and following up:</p><ul><li><strong>Lead generation</strong>: it started with Demo Day of course, from which we got 100+ leads but none of them ended up investing (more on that below). After that we mainly relied on our YC batchmates to identify relevant investors and get the intros.</li><li><strong>Pitching</strong>: we did a conversational pitch without the deck, but we had a Notion one-pager from which I would drop links during the conversation (to e.g. our traction chart, user testimonials etc.). It also worked well as investors would typically find it interesting and keep scrolling through as we talked, asking follow-up questions.</li><li><strong>Following-up</strong>: we followed up once per week. I would usually "batch process" it each Wednesday. We used Streak to identify all the leads that I haven't heard from in over 7 days (there is a filter for that) and then manually emailed them.</li></ul><p>We started with tracking everything in Google Sheets, but with the volume of leads it soon became hard to navigate them through the funnel. Then we switched to Streak (used their fundraising template, and modified it a bit) and that worked great. The most helpful thing for me was having a CRM that is integrated with gmail, that made the process much more seamless and gave us better overview of the funnel. As soon as I would receive an email I could see in which stage the investor is, and it was also super easy to add new investors straight from gmail - it saved us from the dreaded context switching and kept us focused.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-pitch-became-much-better-after-50-meetings">Our pitch became much better after ~50 meetings<a href="#our-pitch-became-much-better-after-50-meetings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our pitch became much better after ~50 meetings" title="Direct link to Our pitch became much better after ~50 meetings">​</a></h2><p>We kept being critical of our pitch and kept a list of questions that we felt needed more work. We called it "creating narratives", e.g. why the right time for our product is now, presenting the team, or how we plan to monetise. We talked to other companies in the same space (devtools, OSS), investigated comparatives (big companies we compared ourselves too), talked to our angels who were domain experts and used all that to build a more convincing story.</p><p>I never intended to learn our pitch by heart, but after delivering it for 100s of times just that happened - both me and Martin (my brother and cofounder, who wasn't pitching but was always sitting behind me and provided feedback, especially in the beginning) knew it word by word and I realised how much more polished it sounds and how much more confident I felt compared to when we just started.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-goal-was-to-get-to-100-nos">Our goal was to get to 100 no's<a href="#our-goal-was-to-get-to-100-nos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our goal was to get to 100 no's" title="Direct link to Our goal was to get to 100 no's">​</a></h2><p>After about 50 meetings (and about 20 VCs having passed on us) we started feeling a bit disheartened, as things didn't seem to go so easy as we initially expected. Then I chatted to a friend who also recently finished their fundraise and he gave me a tour of Streak - I saw their numbers and that over 150 investors passed on them! With that I realised our 20 passes were just the beginning and that instead of chasing yeses we should actually chase no's :) - they are more predictable, you'll get plenty of them and they will clearly show your progress.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-had-100-leads-from-demo-day---none-of-them-invested">We had 100+ leads from Demo Day - none of them invested<a href="#we-had-100-leads-from-demo-day---none-of-them-invested" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We had 100+ leads from Demo Day - none of them invested" title="Direct link to We had 100+ leads from Demo Day - none of them invested">​</a></h2><p>This is probably pretty specific for our case, but it's how it went. Connecting with a startup on Demo Day is a very low-cost action for investors. Also, as many investors as there are on Demo Day, there are even more of them who aren't.</p><p>When we sorted through the connections we got, about 20% were a really good fit for us, meaning they invest in deep tech / OSS companies, have invested recently, invest in our stage etc.</p><p>We still met with pretty much all the interested leads, but we quickly realised that due to our product being deeply technical and the company being pre-revenue, only investors with engineering backgrounds were really interested because they could understand and get excited about what we do. That informed us to generate our leads with much narrower focus.</p><p>We looked at other OSS &amp; dev tools companies in our batch, looked at who invested in them and asked for intros. Our batchmates were also in the fundraising mode, they knew how hard it can be and they wanted to help, so everything moved very quickly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-learned-not-to-spend-time-on-non-believers">We learned not to spend time on non-believers<a href="#we-learned-not-to-spend-time-on-non-believers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We learned not to spend time on non-believers" title="Direct link to We learned not to spend time on non-believers">​</a></h2><p>As we learned to focus on the highly qualified leads, we also learned that it is very hard (impossible) to change somebody's mind. Plenty of investors liked u and what we do, but they were skeptical about e.g. market size or monetisation potential and made that clear from the start. Many of them were keen to keep chatting, wanted to meet our angel investors etc., but none of that helped change their mind and it was very distracting for us. I believe it is very hard to change somebody's worldview, especially in the seed stage when there is often no strong factual evidence to do so.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="passing-through-the-valley-of-death">Passing through the "valley of death"<a href="#passing-through-the-valley-of-death" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Passing through the &quot;valley of death&quot;" title="Direct link to Passing through the &quot;valley of death&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As you can see on the chart, about two months in we barely passed $300k, and we had a whole month with no progress. At the same time, we felt that our pitch got significantly better and we were reaching investors much better suited for us.
It was one of the most difficult times, seeing others close their rounds, but we decided to trust in the process and keep going until we have used all the resources we had. It was also the time our lead investor took time to do their own pretty extensive due diligence on Wasp, so although it looks like no progress was made from the outside, a lot of stuff was actually happening behind the scenes.</p><p>Suddenly, a few things clicked together from multiple sides and our round was quickly closed, even oversubscribed! It was truly a magical feeling to start closing investors in a single day, even during the first call, when previously it took us weeks to close our first $50k check. The big factor was also that our round was getting filled up and that of course motivated investors to move faster.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-compared-ourselves-to-big-successful-companies">We compared ourselves to big, successful companies<a href="#we-compared-ourselves-to-big-successful-companies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We compared ourselves to big, successful companies" title="Direct link to We compared ourselves to big, successful companies">​</a></h2><p>This is one of the best pieces of advice we got from YC partners about fundraising. In the beginning we didn't understand how important this was, but once the meetings started we realised this was one of the best ways to explain the potential of our company to investors. With the innovation in technology that isn't easy to grasp, they needed something to hold on to understand how the business model and distribution could work, and it sounds much more doable if there is a playbook we can follow rather than us reinventing that as well. We kept working on finding a good comparable (we had a few) and explaining in which ways we are similar and why.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="good-luck---you-can-do-it">Good luck - you can do it!<a href="#good-luck---you-can-do-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Good luck - you can do it!" title="Direct link to Good luck - you can do it!">​</a></h2><p>I hope you found this helpful and that our story will motivate you to keep going once things get hard! We wish you the best of luck and also feel free to reach out if you'll have any questions.</p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After graduating from Y Combinator's Winter 2021 Batch, we are super excited to announce that Wasp raised $1.5m in our first funding round! The round is led by Lunar Ventures and joined by HV Capital.

They share the vision we have with Wasp, understand and care about the problem we are solving.</p><p><em>Wasp is a configuration language (DSL) for building full-stack web apps with less code and best practices that works alongside React and Node.js. We are on a mission to streamline web app development while empowering developers to continue using the power of code and their favorite tools. We are backed by Y Combinator and engineers from Airbnb, Facebook, and Lyft.</em></p><p class="in-blog-cta-link-container"><a href="https://e44cy1h4s0q.typeform.com/to/ycUzQa5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">We are in Beta (try it out)!</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Join our community</a><span class="in-blog-cta--divider"> → </span><a href="https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Founding-Engineer-at-Wasp-402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="in-blog-cta--link">Work with us</a></p><p>Besides Lunar and HV Capital, we are thrilled to welcome on board:</p><ul><li>468 Capital (led by Florian Leibert, founder of Mesosphere and ex-Twitter and Airbnb eng.)</li><li>Charlie Songhurst</li><li>Tokyo Black</li><li>Acequia Capital</li><li>Abstraction Capital</li><li>Ben Tossell, founder of Makerpad (acq. by Zapier)</li><li>Muthukrishnan Ramabadran, Senior Software Engineer at Lyft</li><li>Yun-Fang, ex-Facebook engineer</li><li>Marcel P.

Open-source is one of the most powerful ways to write software and we want to make sure Wasp is freely accessible to every developer.</p><p>Wasp is a technically innovative and challenging project. Even though we are not building a new general programming language from scratch, there still exists an essential complexity of building a language and all the tooling around it. Wasp offers a lot of abstractions that are being introduced for the first time and there is no clear blueprint to follow, and this is why such an undertaking requires full-time attention and dedication. Hence, we plan on expanding the team with some amazing engineers to accelerate us on our journey.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-are-we-today">Where are we today?<a href="#where-are-we-today" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where are we today?" title="Direct link to Where are we today?">​</a></h2><p>Today, Wasp is in Alpha. That means there are many features we still have to add and many that are probably going to change. But it also means you can <a href="/docs">try it out, build a full-stack web app</a> and see what it is all about. You can also join <a href="https://discord.gg/rzdnErX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our community</a> and share your feedback and experience with us - we'd be happy to hear from you!</p><p>Since we launched our Alpha several months ago, we got some amazing feedback on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/wasp-lang-alpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product Hunt</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News</a>.</p><p>We've also grown a lot and recently passed 1,000 stars on <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Github repo</a> - thank you!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Wasp GitHub Stars" src="/assets/images/wasp-gh-stars-raise-ad8427810a2af7e670977401a4838b39.png" width="932" height="618" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To date, over 250 projects have been created with Wasp in the last couple of months and some were even deployed to production - like <a href="https://farnance.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farnance</a> that ended up being a hackathon winner!

Having led development of several complex web apps in the past and continuously switching to the latest stack, we felt the pain and could also clearly see the patterns that we felt were mature and common enough to be worth extracting into a simpler, higher-level language.</p><p align="center"></p><figure><img loading="lazy" alt="The team" src="/img/us-at-ycombinator.jpg" class="img_ev3q"><figcaption>Martin and I during our first YC interview.

There we first encountered the modern web stack and went on to lead development of web platforms in fintech and bioinformatics space. We also had a startup previously (<a href="https://talkbook.co/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TalkBook</a>), where we learned a lot about talking to users and building something that solves a problem they have.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-comes-next">What comes next?<a href="#what-comes-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What comes next?" title="Direct link to What comes next?">​</a></h2><p>With the funding secured, we can now fully focus on developing Wasp and the ecosystem around it. We can start planning for more <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term features</a> that we couldn't fully commit to until now, and we can expand our team to move faster and bring more great people on board with new perspectives and enable them to fully employ their knowledge and creativity without any distractions.</p><p>Our immediate focus is to bring Wasp to Beta and then 1.0 (see our high-level roadmap <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/#what-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), while also building a strong foundation for our open source community. We believe community is the key to the success for Wasp and we will do everything in our power to make sure everybody feels welcome and has a fun and rewarding experience both building apps and contributing to the project.

For function <code>f</code>, it means it is saying "for all types, this function takes that type and returns the same type.".
Other way to put it would be "this funtion can be called with value of any type as its first argument, and it will return the value of that same type".</p><p>Since <code>forall</code> is already implicit, writing it explicitly doesn't really do anything!</p><p>Not only that, but without any extensions, you can't even write <code>forall</code> explicitly, you will get a syntax error, since <code>forall</code> is not a keyword in Haskell.</p><p>So what is the purpose of <code>forall</code> then? Well, obviously to be used with extensions :)!</p><p>The simplest extension is <code>ExplicitForAll</code>, which allows you to explicitly write <code>forall</code> (as we did above).
This is not useful on its own though, since as we said above, explicitly writing <code>forall</code> doesn't change anything, it was already implicitly there.</p><p>However, there are other extensions that make use of <code>forall</code> keyword, like: <code>ScopedTypeVariables</code>, <code>RankNTypes</code>, <code>ExistentialQuantification</code>.
All these extensions automatically enable <code>ExplicitForAll</code> extension, which means you don't need to enable it yourself when using any of these.
There is also <code>TypeApplications</code> extension which interacts with <code>forall</code> and in that case you might want to use <code>ExplicitForAll</code> with it.</p><p>Since <code>forall</code> is useful only when used with extensions, let's take a look at how it is used in each one of those!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables"><code>forall</code> and extension <a href="https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#lexically-scoped-type-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScopedTypeVariables</a><a href="#forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables" title="Direct link to forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables">​</a></h2><p><code>ScopedTypeVariables</code> enables lexical scoping of type variables by explicitly introducing them with <code>forall</code>.</p><p>Let's take a look at the following example:</p><div class="language-hs codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-hs codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token hvariable">f</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">::</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token hvariable">a</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">-&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token hvariable">a</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token hvariable">f</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">xs</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">ys</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">++</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">ys</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">where</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">ys</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">::</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token hvariable">a</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        </span><span class="token hvariable">ys</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token builtin">reverse</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">xs</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>This code does not compile, because compiler can't match type of <code>ys</code> with the return type of <code>f</code>.

On the other hand, <code>bar</code> needs a function that takes value of <strong>some</strong> type and returns the value of that same type, so <code>specificFunc</code> is completely fine since it works only with <code>Int</code>, while <code>polymorphicFunc</code> is also ok although it is more general than what is needed, since compiler can easily specialize it. </p><p>Another example is <code>liftPair</code> function:</p><div class="language-hs codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-hs codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token hvariable">liftPair</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">::</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token hvariable">forall</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">x</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">x</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">-&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">f</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">x</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">-&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token hvariable">a</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">b</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">-&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token hvariable">f</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">a</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">f</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">b</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token hvariable">liftPair</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">func</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token hvariable">y</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">z</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token hvariable">func</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">y</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">func</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token hvariable">z</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&gt;&gt;

title="Direct link to forall-and-extension-typeapplications">​</a></h2><p><code>TypeApplications</code> does not change how <code>forall</code> works like the extensions above do, but it does have an interesting interaction with <code>forall</code>, so we will mention it here.</p><p><code>TypeApplications</code> allows you to specify values of types variables in a type.</p><p>For example, you can do <code>show (read @Int "5")</code> to specify that <code>"5"</code> should be interpreted as an <code>Int</code>.
<code>read</code> has type signature <code>:: Read a =&gt; String -&gt; a</code>, so what <code>@Int</code> does is say that that <code>a</code> in the type signature is <code>Int</code>.
Therefore, <code>read @Int :: String -&gt; Int</code>.</p><p>How does <code>forall</code> come into play here?</p><p>Well, if an identifier’s type signature does not include an explicit <code>forall</code>, the type variable arguments appear in the left-to-right order in which the variables appear in the type. So, <code>foo :: Monad m =&gt; a b -&gt; m (a c)</code> will have its type variables ordered as <code>m</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and type applications will happen in that order: if we have <code>foo @Maybe @Either</code>, <code>@Maybe</code> will apply to <code>m</code> while <code>@Either</code> will apply to <code>a</code>. However, if you want to force a different order, for example <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>m</code>, so that <code>@Maybe</code> in <code>foo @Maybe @Either</code> applies to <code>a</code>, you can refactor the signature as <code>foo :: forall a b c m. Monad m =&gt; a b -&gt; m (a c)</code>, and now order of type variables in <code>forall</code> will be used when doing type applications!</p><p>This will require you to enable <code>ExplicitForAll</code> extension, if it is not already enabled.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This document should give a fair idea of how <code>forall</code> is used and what can be done with it, but it doesn't go into much depth or cover all of the ways <code>forall</code> is used in Haskell.</p><p>For more in-detail explanations and further investigation, here is a couple of useful resources:</p><ul><li>Great SO question/answers: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do</a> .</li><li>Docs on extensions, which in details describe how each of them works: <a href="https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html</a> .</li><li><a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/explicit_forall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/explicit_forall.html</a> .</li><li>Article about <code>ST</code> monad that also explains a lot about <code>forall</code>: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/178243.178246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/178243.178246</a> . </li></ul><p>This blog post originated from the <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/35f14951b17f2174cbc269628bea157b6698a9e4/forall.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes I wrote in wasp-lang/haskell-handbook</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are two ways to accomplish what we need:</p><ol><li><strong>Adding a role that grants access</strong>. When they join, they have no roles. Once they introduce themselves, they are granted a role (e.g. <code>Member</code> or <code>Waspeteer</code>) that is required to access the rest of the server.</li><li><strong>Removing a role that forbids access</strong>. When they join, they are automatically assigned a role <code>Guest</code>, for which we configured the non-public channels to deny access. Once they introduce themselves, the role <code>Guest</code> gets removed and they gain access to the rest of the server.</li></ol><p>We decided to go with the second approach since it means we don't have to assign all the existing members with a new role. From now on, we will be talking about how to get this second approach working.</p><p>To get this going, we need to do the following:</p><ol><li>Create role <code>Guest</code>.</li><li>Ensure that the <code>Guest</code> role has permissions to access only "public" channels.
One convenient way to go about this is to disable "View Channels" permission for the role <code>Guest</code> at the level of Category, so it propagates to all the channels in it, instead of doing it for every single channel.
Once you are done, use the "See server as a role" feature of Discord to confirm that you set the permissions as you wanted.</li><li>Automatically inform new members that they must introduce themselves in the <code>introductions</code> channel with <code>!intro &lt;text_about_me&gt;</code> to gain access to the rest of the server.
This can be done via Discord's "Welcome Screen" feature or via one of the many existing Discord bots out there offering this functionality.</li><li>Automatically assign the <code>Guest</code> role to a new member when they join the server.</li><li>Automatically remove the <code>Guest</code> role when a member introduces themselves in the public <code>introductions</code> channel.</li></ol><p>#1, #2 and #3 are relatively straight-forward.</p><p>For the #4 (automatic assignment of the role when a new member joins the server), since Discord doesn't support this directly, you will need a bot to do it.
Luckily, many bots allow you to auto-assign roles when new members join, and I ended up using <a href="https://mee6.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MEE6</a> for this.
I set it up so that when a new member joins, they are immediately assigned a <code>Guest</code> role.</p><p>However, for the #5 (remove or assign the role on a message in a specific channel), the situation is more complicated - I couldn't find a single bot out there that supports this!
The closest I got was with <a href="https://carl.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl Bot</a> and its "tags" feature, which allows you to write custom code, but in the end, it turned out to be too restrictive to accomplish this.
Therefore, I ended up implementing our own bot (Wasp Bot) that does this.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-a-discord-bot-nodejs">Implementing a Discord Bot (NodeJS)<a href="#implementing-a-discord-bot-nodejs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementing a Discord Bot (NodeJS)" title="Direct link to Implementing a Discord Bot (NodeJS)">​</a></h2><p>I decided to implement a bot in NodeJS since it is easy to get started quickly and there is a good Discord library.</p><p>I will describe how to create it step by step below, but <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp-bot/tree/4b3858202622c7635aeb6f1d71d9ba9781eea6eb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is the final code of the bot</a> if you want to skip ahead.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="defining-bot-on-discord-and-adding-it-to-your-server">Defining bot on Discord and adding it to your server.<a href="#defining-bot-on-discord-and-adding-it-to-your-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Defining bot on Discord and adding it to your server." title="Direct link to Defining bot on Discord and adding it to your server.">​</a></h3><p>Before we even start implementing the bot, we will tell Discord about it first, in order to obtain the neccessary credentials that we will use in our code, and we will add the bot to our server.
There are many tutorials already on how to do this, so I will keep it short.</p><ol><li>Go to Discord Developer Portal, create a new Application -&gt; I named it <code>Wasp</code>.</li><li>Go to the "Bot" part of Application "Settings" and add a new bot. I named it <code>WaspBot</code>.</li><li>On the "Bot" page of your freshly created bot, there is a "TOKEN" part -&gt; create a mental note about it, we will need this later when running our bot.</li><li>Go to the "OAuth2" part of Application "Settings". Here we will define which permissions our bot will have.
This is done by checking the permissions we want to give it and then following the URL that will be generated based on our choices.<ul><li>Check the <code>bot</code> under the "SCOPES" section.</li><li>Scroll down further to find the "BOT PERMISSIONS" section. There, check the <code>Manage Roles</code>, <code>View Channels</code>, <code>Read Message History</code>, and <code>Send Messages</code>.</li><li>Under the "SCOPES" section above, you will see a URL. Copy it into the browser and follow the steps to add the bot to your server.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-a-basic-bot-in-nodejs">Creating a basic bot in NodeJS<a href="#creating-a-basic-bot-in-nodejs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating a basic bot in NodeJS" title="Direct link to Creating a basic bot in NodeJS">​</a></h3><p>In a directory where your code will be, create a new npm project with <code>npm init</code> -&gt; set the entry point to <code>bot.js</code> instead of <code>index.js</code>.

<!-- -->This led us to the idea of extracting common web app features and concepts into a special specification language (Wasp), while the implementation details are still described via a modern stack (right now React, Node.js, Prisma).</p><p>Our vision with Wasp is to create <strong>a powerful but simple language where you can describe your web app as humanly as possible</strong>.
We want to make the top of that iceberg on the image above as pleasant as possible while making the bottom part much smaller.<br>
<!-- -->In such language, with just a few words, you can specify pages and their routes, specify which type of authentication you want, define basic entities / data models, describe basic data flow, choose where you want to deploy, implement specific details in React/Node, and let Wasp take care of connecting it all, building it and deploying it.</p><div class="language-css

language (DSL), aren’t frameworks solving this already?">​</a></h2><p>Frameworks (like e.g. Ruby on Rails or Meteor) are a big inspiration to us.
However, we want to take things one step further - by designing a language specialized for the domain of web apps (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DSL</a>) we can get rid of a lot of boilerplate and provide a cleaner &amp; simpler developer experience.</p><p>On the other hand, we are not trying to replace everything with Wasp nor think that would make sense - just the opposite, Wasp acts as a “glue” between your React and Node.js code, saving you from the grunt work while allowing you to keep the flexibility of writing your own code.
<strong>The majority of the code is still being written in React and Node.js, with Wasp serving as the backbone of your whole application.</strong></p><p>Another benefit of a DSL is that it allows Wasp to <strong>understand the web app’s requirements during the build time and reason about it</strong> before generating the final code, and this is what we are especially excited about.</p><p>For example, when generating code to be deployed to production, it could pick the most appropriate architecture based on its understanding of the web app and deploy it to serverless or another type of architecture (or even a combination).
Another example would be reusing your data model logic through all the parts of the stack while defining it just once in Wasp.</p><p>DSL opens the potential for optimizations, static analysis, extensibility, and unparalleled ergonomics.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does it work?" title="Direct link to How does it work?">​</a></h2><p>Wasp compiler compiles the .wasp/React/Node.js source code into just React/Node.js target code.<br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" alt="Martin &amp; Matija at YCombinator HQ" src="/img/us-at-ycombinator.jpg" height="400px" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Wasp became part of Winter 2021 YCombinator batch!</p><p>Here we describe our journey and how we got in after applying for the third time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-beginning">The beginning<a href="#the-beginning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The beginning" title="Direct link to The beginning">​</a></h2><p>About 2 years ago (start of 2019) brother and I first started thinking about the idea of a (domain specific) language that is specialized for full-stack web app development - language that removes boilerplate and makes web development simpler.
We named it Wasp (Web App SPecification).</p><p>After working on it for about a year as a side-project (researching the space, talking with potential users, building a prototype, learning), we realized it will take our full-time dedication to make something serious out of it, so we quit the current job and went all-in into Wasp, bootstrapping ourselves while working on it, to see how far we can get.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-journey-to-ycombinator">The journey to YCombinator<a href="#the-journey-to-ycombinator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The journey to YCombinator" title="Direct link to The journey to YCombinator">​</a></h2><p>Due to the nature of Wasp (open-source, web framework / language), we were aware that we will need to raise funds at some point if we want to survive.
We had a startup of our own previously, and we worked in multiple startups in the past, so we already knew quite a bit about how to go about it and what to expect.</p><p>Therefore, as soon as we went full-time into it (start of 2020), we immediately applied for YCombinator (top startup accelerator in the world). Soon, we got invited to the USA (we are from Europe) for the final on-site interview!</p><p>We spent weeks preparing for the interview, polishing our pitch, vision, business plan, our understanding of our users, doing mock interviews - all for those crucial 10 minutes (yes, interview lasts only 10 minutes!).
At the end we didn’t pass the final interview, however we got encouraging feedback that, although we are too early, we have potential and should try applying again when we make more progress.
This made a lot of sense to us, since we had only a very basic prototype and little traction.</p><p>We decided to continue working on Wasp for some longer time and continue applying to YC and talking with other interesting accelerators/investors, and see where that gets us - if nothing else, we will learn a lot on the way :)!</p><p>Half a year later, after making progress on multiple sides, we went for a second interview (this time online due to Covid) and while we felt it was really close, we still didn’t get in - they wanted to see more traction, more proof that people want it.</p><p>Finally, by the autumn of 2020, we were in a position where we had released an early-alpha version of Wasp, managed to build an initial community (&gt;50 people on Discord, 500 Github stars) and made it to “Product of the day” on the Product Hunt.
With all that we applied for the YC for the third time and made it in!</p><p>Interesting fact is that if you applied to YC previously and got rejected, that is actually a plus when you apply the next time (it show persistence, and they can see your progress).
Also, while we did spend significant time preparing for the YC interviews, all that preparation also helped us get a better understanding of our idea, what our users(developers) really need and how to properly present it, so it was worth it regardless of the result of the interviews.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-now">What now?<a href="#what-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What now?" title="Direct link to What now?">​</a></h2><p>Right now (Feb 2020) we are in the middle of the YCombinator program, building community, talking with developers and developing Wasp toward beta.</p><p>It is still just the two of us and Wasp is in early stage, but with amazing community members on our side and with YC backing us up, we are not afraid to dream big!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year or so ago, brother and I started discussing how awesome it would be to have a programming language that would understand what “web app” means. Such language would, on one hand, serve as an expressive specification of the web app, while on the other hand, it would take care of “boring” work for us, while we could focus on the business logic specific for our web app.</p><p>Step by step, the idea has started to take a more concrete shape, and Wasp (Web Application SPecification language) came to life! While still very early, we are writing this blog post to explain why are we building Wasp, what is the current status and what the future may hold.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-specification-less-implementation">More specification, less implementation<a href="#more-specification-less-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More specification, less implementation" title="Direct link to More specification, less implementation">​</a></h2><p>Imagine you want to create a simple Todo web app.</p><p>You would explain it like this to your best buddy web developer: “I want to create a web app with the title ‘Todo App’ that has a single page with a list of tasks. Each task has a description and can be either marked as done or not done. The list starts as empty and tasks can be added, deleted or marked as done. I will send you designs for this. Also, I want a user to be required to register/log in.”</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at what needs to be done to implement such an app. We need to choose technologies we are going to use (frontend, backend, database, …), figure out the project file structure, set up the build toolchain, configure linting/auto-formatting/style-guide, set up tests (unit/integration, e2e), set up deployment (production, staging), set up code sharing between frontend and backend, … . Then, once everything is set up, we need to implement basic CRUD functionality (components on frontend and API on the backend), user management, probably some kind of menu on the frontend, …</p><p>We can easily see that explanation to web developer (specification) is short and concise because many details are implicit or assumed to be handled in a reasonable default way. On the other hand, implementation is complicated since it has to take care of all the details, many of them not unique for the web app we are building but common for most of the web apps. Also, if we consider the specification through time, it would look the same now and 5 years ago. On the other hand, implementation would be different, due to the new technologies that have emerged in the meantime.</p><p>So if the specification is time-resilient, short and relatively simple to describe, while implementation is complex, volatile and requires a lot of expert knowledge, how great would it be to write more of specification and less of implementation when building a web app? For that, we need more powerful languages, that will be able to express more in less code. This is where Wasp comes in.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wasp">Wasp!<a href="#wasp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wasp!" title="Direct link to Wasp!">​</a></h2><p>The idea behind Wasp is to take everything repetitive and common in the development of a typical web app and have Wasp take care of those parts for us. Ideally, programming in Wasp would very much look like describing the specification to the web developer, therefore writing more specification and less implementation. Wasp is the one who will keep evolving and making sure your specification is implemented in the best possible technology using the industry best practices.</p><p>To achieve that, we made Wasp as a DSL (domain-specific language) that understands common concepts of a web app like pages, routes, frontend and backend and their relationship, entities, user and roles/permissions, etc. Other parts, those that are specific for our web app (business logic), we can still write in html/css/js/…, and then plug them into Wasp, combining the power of Wasp with the flexibility of existing technologies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-up">What’s up?<a href="#whats-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s up?" title="Direct link to What’s up?">​</a></h2><p>We are currently working on the first version of Wasp compiler, and are planning to soon have very first, MVP version ready. It will be just the first step of our vision of what Wasp could be, but the sooner we get it out there, the sooner we can start collecting feedback and further shaping Wasp together with the community.</p><p>We believe it will take significant effort to bring Wasp to the level where a big portion of developers will be able to build the whole app with Wasp without feeling restrained by missing flexibility or options, while on the other hand, we don’t want to wait too long until people can start using Wasp. Therefore, we decided to build it from start in such a way that a developer can at any moment “eject” from Wasp and continue on their own, where “ejecting” would mean that Wasp would generate the source code of web app that you can continue working on. That is why compiler for Wasp that we are building is actually a transpiler whose output is web app written with best practices, that you can at any moment take and continue from there if you feel too limited by Wasp. It is like having a senior developer guide you through writing a web app!</p><p>This poses the following question: “In which technologies will web app that Wasp transpiler produces be implemented?”. Well, while our vision is to offer multiple flavors here, so that you can choose the combination of technologies that you want to use, for a start we are going with one fixed technology stack, based on most popular technologies: React, Redux, NodeJS, and Mongo.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="moar">Moar<a href="#moar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Moar" title="Direct link to Moar">​</a></h2><p>One thing that we are very excited about regarding Wasp is that Wasp understands the way web app is built. So, once you describe it in Wasp, there are many things we could be able to do with it. We could automatically generate tests since we understand the requirements. We could suggest solutions on how to improve the design of the web app. Also, since Wasp should make building web apps easier, we could build solutions on top of it, for example, a visual builder that generates Wasp code, that in turn generates a web app.</p><p>We are still very early in the Wasp journey but we are very excited about the opportunities that we imagine it could bring and about the possibilities it could unlock. We hope that this blog post will inspire others to discuss this concept and that together we will create something amazing and learn a lot on the way!</p>]]></content:encoded>
