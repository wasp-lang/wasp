We advise that you additionaly check what is the value for "minimal number of machines running" on Fly
for this server app and confirm that it is set to the value you are OK with.

Be aware that if it is set to 0, your server will shut down when there are no requests from the client,
which might be an issue for you if you have recurring Jobs or some other processes that need to keep
running on the server even without external input, in which case we advise keeping "minimal number
of machines running" setting at a number larger than zero.
