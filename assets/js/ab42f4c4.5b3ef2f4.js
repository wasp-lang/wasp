Examples will follow.\n\nImportant Wasp features:\n  - Routes and Pages: client side, Pages are written in React.\n  - Queries and Actions: RPC, called from client, execute on server (nodejs).\n    Queries are for fetching and should not do any mutations, Actions are for mutations.\n  - Entities: central data models, defined via PSL (Prisma schema language), manipulated via Prisma.\nTypical flow: Routes point to Pages, Pages call Queries and Actions, Queries and Actions work with Entities.\n\nExample main.wasp (comments are explanation for you):\n\n```wasp\napp todoApp {\n  wasp: { version: "^0.11.1" },\n  title: "ToDo App",\n  auth: {\n    userEntity: User,\n    methods: { usernameAndPassword: {} },\n    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"\n  },\n  client: {\n    rootComponent: import { Layout } from "@client/Layout.jsx",\n  },\n  db: {\n    prisma: {\n      clientPreviewFeatures: ["extendedWhereUnique"]\n    }\n  },\n}\n\nroute SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }\npage SignupPage {\n  component: import Signup from "@client/pages/auth/Signup.jsx"\n}\n\nroute LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }\npage LoginPage {\n  component: import Login from "@client/pages/auth/Login.jsx"\n}\n\nroute DashboardRoute { path: "/", to: Dashboard }\npage DashboardPage {\n  authRequired: true,\n  component: import Dashboard from "@client/pages/Dashboard.jsx"\n}\n\nentity User {=psl\n    id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())\n    username    String    @unique\n    password    String\n    tasks       Task[]\npsl=}\n\nentity Task {=psl\n    id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())\n    description String\n    isDone      Boolean   @default(false)\n    user        User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])\n    userId      Int\npsl=}\n\nquery getUser {\n  fn: import { getUser } from "@server/queries.js",\n  entities: [User] // Entities that this query operates on.\n}\n\nquery getTasks {\n  fn: import { getTasks } from "@server/queries.js",\n  entities: [Task]\n}\n\naction createTask {\n  fn: import { createTask } from "@server/actions.js",\n  entities: [Task]\n}\n\naction updateTask {\n  fn: import { updateTask } from "@server/actions.js",\n  entities: [Task]\n}\n```\n\nWe are looking for a plan to build a new Wasp app (description at the end of prompt).\n\nInstructions you must follow while generating plan:\n  - App uses username and password authentication.\n  - App MUST have a \'User\' entity, with following fields required:\n  - `id Int @id @default(autoincrement())`\n  - `username String @unique`\n  - `password String`\nIt is also likely to have a field that refers to some other entity that user owns, e.g. `tasks Task[]`.\n  - One of the pages in the app must have a route path "/".\n  - Don\'t generate the Login or Signup pages and routes under any circumstances. They are already generated.\n\nPlan is represented as JSON with the following schema:\n\n{\n  "entities": [{ "entityName": string, "entityBodyPsl": string }],\n  "actions": [{ "opName": string, "opFnPath": string, "opDesc": string }],\n  "queries": [{ "opName": string, "opFnPath": string, "opDesc": string }],\n  "pages": [{ "pageName": string, "componentPath": string, "routeName": string, "routePath": string, "pageDesc": string }]\n}\n\nHere is an example of a plan (a bit simplified, as we didn\'t list all of the entities/actions/queries/pages):\n\n{\n  "entities": [{\n    "entityName": "User",\n    "entityBodyPsl": "  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())\\n  username String @unique\\n  password String\\n  tasks Task[]"\n  }],\n  "actions": [{\n    "opName": "createTask",\n    "opFnPath": "@server/actions.js",\n    "opDesc": "Checks that user is authenticated and if so, creates new Task belonging to them. Takes description as an argument and by default sets isDone to false. Returns created Task."\n  }],\n  "queries": [{\n    "opName": "getTask",\n    "opFnPath": "@server/queries.js",\n    "opDesc": "Takes task id as an argument. Checks that user is authenticated, and if so, fetches and returns their task that has specified task id. Throws HttpError(400) if tasks exists but does not belong to them."\n  }],\n  "pages": [{\n    "pageName": "TaskPage",\n    "componentPath": "@client/pages/Task.jsx",\n    "routeName: "TaskRoute",\n    "routePath": "/task/:taskId",\n    "pageDesc": "Diplays a Task with the specified taskId. Allows editing of the Task. Uses getTask query and createTask action.",\n  }]\n}\n\nWe will later use this plan to write main.wasp file and all the other parts of Wasp app,\nso make sure descriptions are detailed enough to guide implementing them.\nAlso, mention in the descriptions of actions/queries which entities they work with,\nand in descriptions of pages mention which actions/queries they use.\n\nTypically, plan will have AT LEAST one query, at least one action, at least one page, and at\nleast two entities. It will very likely have more than one of each, though.\n\nDO NOT create actions for login and logout under any circumstances. They are already included in Wasp.\n\nNote that we are using SQLite as a database for Prisma, so don\'t use scalar arrays in PSL, like `String[]`,\nas those are not supported in SQLite. You can of course normally use arrays of other models, like `Task[]`.\n\nPlease, respond ONLY with a valid JSON that is a plan.\nThere should be no other text in the response.\n\n==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====\n\nApp name: TodoApp\nA simple todo app with one main page that lists all the tasks. User can create new tasks by providing their description, toggle existing ones, or edit their description. User owns tasks. User can only see and edit their own tasks. Tasks are saved in the database.\n')))),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"comparison-test"},"Comparison Test"),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"prompt-1-pong-game"},"Prompt 1: PONG Game"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"To get a sense for how each coding agent performed, I tried out two different prompts on both Smol-Developer and Wasp\u2019s GPT Web App Generator with only slight modifications to the prompts to fit the requirements of each tool."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The first prompt was the default prompt that comes hardcoded into Smol-Developer\u2019s ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"[main.py](http://main.py)")," script:"),(0,o.kt)("blockquote",null,(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"a simple JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Canvas app that is a one player game of PONG.
