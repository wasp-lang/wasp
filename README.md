Wasp (**W**eb **A**pplication **Sp**ecification) is a Rails-like framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma.  
Build your app in a day and deploy it with a single CLI command!

### Why is Wasp awesome
- üöÄ **Quick start**: Due to its expressiveness, you can create and deploy a production-ready web app from scratch with very few lines of concise, consistent, declarative code.
- üòå **No boilerplate**: By abstracting away complex full-stack features, there is less boilerplate code. That means less code to maintain and understand! It also means easier upgrades.
- üîì **No lock-in**: You can deploy the Wasp app anywhere you like. There is no lock-in into specific providers; you have full control over the code (and can actually check it out in .wasp/ dir if you are interested ).

### Features
 üîí Full-stack Auth, üñáÔ∏è RPC (Client <-> Server), üöÄ Simple Deployment, ‚öô Ô∏èJobs, ‚úâÔ∏è Email Sending, üõü Full-stack Type Safety, ...

### Code example

Simple Wasp config file in which you describe the high-level details of your web app:
```js
// file: main.wasp

app todoApp {
  title: "ToDo App",  // visible in the browser tab
  wasp: { version: "^0.11.0" },
  auth: { // full-stack auth out-of-the-box
    userEntity: User, methods: { email: {...} }
  }
}

route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage }
page MainPage {
  authRequired: true, // Limit access to logged-in users.
  component: import Main from "@client/Main.tsx" // Your React code.
}

query getTasks {
  fn: import { getTasks } from "@server/tasks.js", // Your Node.js code.
  entities: [Task] // Automatic cache invalidation.
}

entity Task {=psl  // Your Prisma data model.
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    description String
    isDone      Boolean @default(false)
psl=}
```

The rest of the code you write in React / Node.js / Prisma and just reference it from the .wasp file.

### How it works

Given a simple .wasp configuration file that describes the high-level details of your web app, and .js(x)/.css/..., source files with your unique logic, Wasp compiler generates the full source of your web app in the target stack: front-end, back-end and deployment.

This unique approach is what makes Wasp "smart" and gives it its superpowers!

# Get started

Run
```
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh
```
to install Wasp on OSX/Linux/WSL(Win). From there, just follow the instructions to run your first app in less than a minute!

For more details, check out [the docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs).

# This repository

This is the main repo of the Wasp universe, containing core code (mostly `waspc` - Wasp compiler) and the supporting materials.

# Project status

Currently, Wasp is in beta, with most features flushed out and working well.
However, there are still a lot of improvements and additions that we have in mind for the future, and we are working on them constantly, so you can expect a lot of changes and improvements in the future.

While the idea is to support multiple web tech stacks in the future, right now, we are focusing on the specific stack: React + react-query, NodeJS + ExpressJS, and Prisma.

# Contributing

Any way you want to contribute is a good way :)!

The best place to start is to check out [waspc/](waspc/), where you can find detailed steps for first-time contributors + technical details about the Wasp compiler.

The core of Wasp is built in Haskell, but there are also a lot of non-Haskell parts of Wasp, so you will certainly be able to find something for you!

Even if you don't plan to submit any code, just joining the discussion on discord [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/686873244791210014?label=chat%20on%20discord)](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and giving your feedback is already great and helps a lot (motivates us and helps us figure out how to shape Wasp)!
