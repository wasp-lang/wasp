# Guides

The guides in this section will walk you through common scenarios you'll encounter when building real-world apps with Wasp. They're more hands-on and to-the-point than the main docs. Pick the one that matches what you're trying to do and follow along!

Since many guides involve third-party libraries or services, some details may drift over time. Where appropriate, each guide shows when it was last updated and which versions it was tested with. If something doesn't work as expected, check the official docs for the tool in question, and feel free to let us know in the comments below each page, so we can update it.

Looking for a guide we don't have yet? [Open an issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues) or drop by [our Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX). We're always looking for new ideas.
