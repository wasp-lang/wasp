title: 7. Adding Authentication
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import { ShowForTs, ShowForJs } from '@site/src/components/TsJsHelpers';

Most apps today require some sort of registration and login flow, so Wasp has first-class support for it. Let's add it to our Todo app!

First, we'll create a Todo list for what needs to be done (luckily we have an app for this now 😄).

- [ ] Create a `User` entity.
- [ ] Tell Wasp to use the username and password authentication.
- [ ] Add login and signup pages.
- [ ] Update the main page to require authentication.
- [ ] Add a relation between `User` and `Task` entities.
- [ ] Modify our queries and actions so that users can only see and modify their tasks.
- [ ] Add a logout button.

## Creating a User Entity

Since Wasp manages authentication, it expects certain fields to exist on the `User` entity. Specifically, it expects a unique `username` field and a `password` field, both of which should be strings.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

entity User {=psl
    id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
    username String @unique
    password String
psl=}
```

As we talked about earlier, we have to remember to update the database schema:

```sh
wasp db migrate-dev
```

## Adding Auth to the Project

Next, we want to tell Wasp that we want to use full-stack [authentication](/docs/auth/overview) in our app:

```wasp {7-16} title="main.wasp"
app TodoApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.11.0"
  },
  title: "Todo app",

  auth: {
    // Tells Wasp which entity to use for storing users.
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      // Enable username and password auth.
      usernameAndPassword: {}
    },
    // We'll see how this is used a bit later.
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  }
}

// ...
```

By doing this, Wasp will create:

- [Auth UI](/docs/auth/ui) with login and signup forms.
- A `logout()` action.
- A React hook `useAuth()`.
- `context.user` for use in Queries and Actions.

:::info
Wasp also supports authentication using [Google](/docs/auth/social-auth/google), [GitHub](/docs/auth/social-auth/github), and [email](/docs/auth/email), with more on the way!

## Adding Login and Signup Pages

Wasp creates the login and signup forms for us, but we still need to define the pages to display those forms on. We'll start by declaring the pages in the Wasp file:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
page SignupPage {
  component: import Signup from "@client/SignupPage.jsx"
}

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import Login from "@client/LoginPage.jsx"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```wasp title="main.wasp"
// ...

route SignupRoute { path: "/signup", to: SignupPage }
page SignupPage {
  component: import Signup from "@client/SignupPage.tsx"
}

route LoginRoute { path: "/login", to: LoginPage }
page LoginPage {
  component: import Login from "@client/LoginPage.tsx"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Great, Wasp now knows these pages exist! Now, the React code for the pages:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx title="src/client/LoginPage.jsx"
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import { LoginForm } from '@wasp/auth/forms/Login'

const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <LoginForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I don't have an account yet (<Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}

export default LoginPage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx title="src/client/LoginPage.tsx"
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import { LoginForm } from '@wasp/auth/forms/Login'

const LoginPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <LoginForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I don't have an account yet (<Link to="/signup">go to signup</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}

export default LoginPage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Signup page is very similar to the login one:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx title="src/client/SignupPage.jsx"
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import { SignupForm } from '@wasp/auth/forms/Signup'

const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <SignupForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}

export default SignupPage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx title="src/client/SignupPage.tsx"
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import { SignupForm } from '@wasp/auth/forms/Signup'

const SignupPage = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
      <SignupForm />
      <br />
      <span>
        I already have an account (<Link to="/login">go to login</Link>).
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}

export default SignupPage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Type-safe links
Since you are using Typescript, you can benefit from using Wasp's type-safe `Link` component and the `routes` object. Check out the [type-safe links docs](/docs/advanced/links) for more details.

</ShowForTs>

## Update the Main Page to Require Auth

We don't want users who are not logged in to access the main page, because they won't be able to create any tasks. So let's make the page private by requiring the user to be logged in:

```wasp {4} title="main.wasp"
// ...

page MainPage {
  authRequired: true,
  component: import Main from "@client/MainPage"
}
```

Now that auth is required for this page, unauthenticated users will be redirected to `/login`, as we specified with `app.auth.onAuthFailedRedirectTo`.

Additionally, when `authRequired` is `true`, the page's React component will be provided a `user` object as prop.

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx {1} title="src/client/MainPage.jsx"
const MainPage = ({ user }) => {
  // Do something with the user
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx {3} title="src/client/MainPage.tsx"
import { User } from '@wasp/entities'

const MainPage = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  // Do something with the user
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ok, time to test this out. Navigate to the main page (`/`) of the app. You'll get redirected to `/login`, where you'll be asked to authenticate.

Since we just added users, you don't have an account yet. Go to the signup page and create one. You'll be sent back to the main page where you will now be able to see the TODO list!

Let's check out what the database looks like. Start the Prisma Studio:

```shell
wasp db studio
```

<img alt="Database demonstration - password hashing"
src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_db_hash_demonstration.gif')}
style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
/>

We see there is a user and that its password is already hashed 🤯

However, you will notice that if you try logging in as different users and creating some tasks, all users share the same tasks. That's because we haven't yet updated the queries and actions to have per-user tasks. Let's do that next.

## Defining a User-Task Relation

First, let's define a one-to-many relation between users and tasks (check the [Prisma docs on relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations)):

```wasp {7,14-15} title="main.wasp"
// ...

entity User {=psl
    id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    username String  @unique
    password String
    tasks    Task[]
psl=}

entity Task {=psl
    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
    description String
    isDone      Boolean @default(false)
    user        User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
    userId      Int?
psl=}

// ...
```

As always, we have to update the database:

```sh
wasp db migrate-dev
```

:::note
We made `user` and `userId` in `Task` optional (via `?`) because that allows us to keep the existing tasks, which don't have a user assigned, in the database. This is not recommended because it allows an unwanted state in the database (what is the purpose of the task not belonging to anybody?) and normally we would not make these fields optional. Instead, we would do a data migration to take care of those tasks, even if it means just deleting them all. However, for this tutorial, for the sake of simplicity, we will stick with this.

## Updating Operations to Check Authentication

Next, let's update the queries and actions to forbid access to non-authenticated users and to operate only on the currently logged-in user's tasks:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js {1,4-6} title="src/server/queries.js"
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

export const getTasks = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.findMany({
    where: { user: { id: context.user.id } },
    orderBy: { id: 'asc' },
  })
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts {3,6-8,10} title="src/server/queries.ts"
import { Task } from '@wasp/entities'
import { GetTasks } from '@wasp/queries/types'
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

export const getTasks: GetTasks<void, Task[]> = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.findMany({
    where: { user: { id: context.user.id } },
    orderBy: { id: 'asc' },
  })
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js {1,4-6,10,16-18} title="src/server/actions.js"
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

export const createTask = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.create({
    data: {
      description: args.description,
      user: { connect: { id: context.user.id } },
    },
  })
}

export const updateTask = async (args, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.updateMany({
    where: { id: args.id, user: { id: context.user.id } },
    data: { isDone: args.isDone },
  })
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts {3,11-13,17,28-30,32} title="src/server/actions.ts"
import { Task } from '@wasp/entities'
import { CreateTask, UpdateTask } from '@wasp/actions/types'
import HttpError from '@wasp/core/HttpError.js'

type CreateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'description'>

export const createTask: CreateTask<CreateTaskPayload, Task> = async (
  args,
  context
) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.create({
    data: {
      description: args.description,
      user: { connect: { id: context.user.id } },
    },
  })
}

type UpdateTaskPayload = Pick<Task, 'id' | 'isDone'>

export const updateTask: UpdateTask<
  UpdateTaskPayload,
  { count: number }
> = async ({ id, isDone }, context) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    throw new HttpError(401)
  }
  return context.entities.Task.updateMany({
    where: { id, user: { id: context.user.id } },
    data: { isDone },
  })
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Due to how Prisma works, we had to convert `update` to `updateMany` in `updateTask` action to be able to specify the user id in `where`.
:::

With these changes, each user should have a list of tasks that only they can see and edit.

Try playing around, adding a few users and some tasks for each of them. Then open the DB studio:

```sh
wasp db studio
```

<img alt="Database demonstration"
src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp_db_demonstration.gif')}
style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
/>

You will see that each user has their tasks, just as we specified in our code!

## Logout Button

Last, but not least, let's add the logout functionality:

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx {2,10} title="src/client/MainPage.jsx"
// ...
import logout from '@wasp/auth/logout'
//...

const MainPage = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      // ...
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx {2,10} title="src/client/MainPage.tsx"
// ...
import logout from '@wasp/auth/logout'
//...

const MainPage = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <div>
      // ...
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is it, we have a working authentication system, and our Todo app is multi-user!
