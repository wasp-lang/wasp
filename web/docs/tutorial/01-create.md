You'll need to have the latest version of Wasp installed locally to follow this tutorial. If you haven't installed it yet, check out the [QuickStart](/docs/quick-start) guide!
:::

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a simple Todo app with Wasp. In the process, we'll take you through the most important and useful features of Wasp.

If you get stuck at any point (or just want to chat), reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and we will help you!

You can find the complete code of the app we're about to build [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/tutorials/TodoApp).

Prefer videos? We have a YouTube tutorial whick walks you through building this Todo app step by step. [Check it out here!](https://youtu.be/R8uOu6ZEr5s).

We've also set up an in-browser dev environment for you on Gitpod which allows you to view and edit the completed app with no installation required.

## Creating a Project

To setup a new Wasp project, run the following command in your terminal

```sh
$ wasp new TodoApp
```

Enter the newly created directory and start the development server:

```sh
$ cd TodoApp
$ wasp start
```

:::note
`wasp start` will take a bit of time to start the server the first time you run it in a new project.
:::

You will see log messages from the client, server, and database setting themselves up. When everything is ready, a new tab should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` with a simple placeholder plage:

/>
<br />
<br />

Wasp has generated for you the full front-end and back-end code the app! Next, we'll take a closer look at how the project is structured.
