# Migration from 0.25 to 0.26

import InstallInstructions from './\_install-instructions.md'

<InstallInstructions version="0.26" />

## What's new in 0.26?

<!-- TBA -->

## How to migrate?

### 1. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp config to `^0.26.0`.

<Tabs sideBySide>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```ts title="main.wasp.ts"
    export default app({
      // highlight-next-line
      wasp: { version: "^0.25.0" },
      // ...
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```ts title="main.wasp.ts"
    export default app({
      // highlight-next-line
      wasp: { version: "^0.26.0" },
      // ...
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And run the following command to update the Wasp libraries in your project:

```bash
wasp install
```

### 2. Update your TypeScript config

Due to `wasp/sdk` package changes, we require some changes to your TypeScript configuration.

In `tsconfig.src.json`, update the `include` field:

<Tabs sideBySide>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```json title="tsconfig.src.json"
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
      },
      // highlight-next-line
      "include": ["src"]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```json title="tsconfig.src.json"
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
      }, 
      // highlight-next-line
      "include": ["src", ".wasp/out/types/app"]
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 3. Update your custom Dockerfile

If you are using a [custom Dockerfile](./deployment/deployment-methods/overview#customizing-the-dockerfile), due to `wasp/sdk` package changes,
you'll have to add a one new additional line to it:

<Tabs sideBySide>
  <TabItem value="before" label="Before">
    ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
    # ...
    COPY sdk .wasp/out/sdk
    COPY libs .wasp/out/libs
    # ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="after" label="After">
    ```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
    # ...
    COPY sdk .wasp/out/sdk
    // highlight-next-line
    COPY types .wasp/out/types
    COPY libs .wasp/out/libs
    # ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 4. Recreate your dev database

The database started by `wasp db start` now uses a password unique to your project, instead of a hardcoded value shared by all Wasp apps. This prevents one Wasp app from accidentally connecting to another app's dev database.

Existing dev databases were initialized with the old password and won't accept the new one, so if you use `wasp db start`, you'll need to recreate your dev database:

1. Delete its Docker volume with `docker volume rm <volume-name>`. You can find the volume name in the output of `wasp db start`, or by looking for a name starting with `wasp-dev-db-` in `docker volume ls`.
2. Run `wasp db start` to create a fresh database, and apply your migrations and seeds as usual.

Note that this deletes your dev database's data. Your production database is not affected.

### 5. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!
