title: Migration from 0.11.X to 0.12.X
---

## What's new in Wasp 0.12.0?

### New project structure

Here's a file tree of a fresh Wasp project created with the previous version of Wasp.
More precisely, this is what you'll get if you run `wasp new myProject` using Wasp 0.11.x:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── main.wasp
├── src
│   ├── client
│   │   ├── Main.css
│   │   ├── MainPage.jsx
│   │   ├── react-app-env.d.ts
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── waspLogo.png
│   ├── server
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   ├── shared
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   └── .waspignore
└── .wasproot
```

Compare that with the file tree of a fresh Wasp project created with Wasp
0.12.0. In other words, this is what you will get by running `wasp new myProject`
from this point onwards:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── main.wasp
├── package.json
├── public
│   └── .gitkeep
├── src
│   ├── Main.css
│   ├── MainPage.jsx
│   ├── queries.ts
│   ├── vite-env.d.ts
│   ├── .waspignore
│   └── waspLogo.png
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── .wasproot

```

The main differences are:

- The server/client code separation is no longer necessary. You can now organize
  your code however you want, as long as it's inside the `src` directory.
- All external imports in your Wasp file must have paths starting with `@src` (e.g., `import foo from '@src/bar.js')
  where `@src` refers to the `src` directory in your project root. The paths can
  no longer start with `@server` or `@client`.
- Your project now features a top-level `public` dir. Wasp will publicly serve
  all the files it finds in this directory. Read more about it
  [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/project/static-assets).

Our [Overview docs](todo link) explain the new
structure in detail, while this page provides a [quick guide](#migrating-your-project-to-the-new-structure) for migrating existing
projects.

### New auth

In Wasp 0.11.X, authentication was based on the `User` model which the developer needed to set up properly and take care of the auth fields like `email` or `password`.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.11.0"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    externalAuthEntity: SocialLogin,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}

entity User {=psl
  id                        Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  username                  String        @unique
  password                  String
  externalAuthAssociations  SocialLogin[]
psl=}

entity SocialLogin {=psl
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  provider    String
  providerId  String
  user        User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId      Int
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  @@unique([provider, providerId, userId])
psl=}
```

From 0.12.X onwards, authentication is based on the auth models which are automatically set up by Wasp. You don't need to take care of the auth fields anymore.

The `User` model is now just a business logic model and you use it for storing the data that is relevant for your app.

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app myApp {
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.12.0"
  },
  title: "My App",
  auth: {
    userEntity: User,
    methods: {
      gitHub: {}
    },
    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: "/login"
  },
}

entity User {=psl
  id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
psl=}
```

:::caution Regression Note: Multiple Auth Identities per User

With our old auth implementation, if you were using both Google and email auth methods, your users could sign up with Google first and then, later on, reset their password and therefore also enable logging in with their email and password. This was the only way in which a single user could have multiple login methods at the same time (Google and email).

This is not possible anymore. **The new auth system doesn't support multiple login methods per user at the moment**. We do plan to add this soon though, with the introduction of the [account merging feature](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/954).

If you have any users that have both Google and email login credentials at the same time, you will have to pick only one of those for that user to keep when migrating them.

:::

You can read more about the new auth system in the [Auth Entities](./entities) section.

## How to Migrate?

These instructions are for migrating your app from Wasp `0.11.X` to Wasp `0.12.X`, meaning they will work for all minor releases that fit this pattern (e.g., the guide applies to `0.12.0`, `0.12.1`, ...).

We suggest you install the latest 0.12.X version of Wasp by running:
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh -s
```

If you get stuck at any point, don't hesitate to ask us on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX).

### Migrating your project to the new structure

You can easily migrate your old Wasp project to the new structure by following a
series of steps. Assuming you have a project called `foo` inside the
directory `foo`, you should:

0. Make sure to backup or save your project before starting the procedure (e.g.,
   by committing it to source control or creating a copy).
1. Install the latest `0.12.x` version of Wasp.
2. Rename your project's root directory to something like `foo_old`.
3. Create a new project by running `wasp new foo`.
4. Delete all files of `foo/src` except `vite-env.d.ts`.
5. If `foo_old/src/client/public` exists and contains any files, copy those files into
   `foo/public`.
6. Copy the contents of `foo_old/src` into `foo/src`.
   `foo/src` should now contain `vite-env.d.ts`, `.waspignore`, and three subdirectories (`server`, `client`, and `shared`).
   Don't change anything about this structure yet.
7. Delete redundant files and folders from `foo/src`:
   - `foo/src/.waspignore` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
   - `foo/src/client/vite-env.d.ts` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
   - `foo/src/client/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
   - `foo/src/server/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
   - `foo/src/shared/tsconfig.json` - A new version of this file already exists at the top level.
   - `foo/src/client/public` - You've moved all the files from this directory in step 5.
8. Update all the `@wasp` imports in your JS/TS source files (i.e., the `foo/src` directory).

   The easiest way to get this done is by using the tool that we prepared
   specifically for this purpose: [wasp-codemod](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp-codemod).

   Clone the `wasp-codemod` repo and look at the `README.md` for instructions. Shortly, you will want to go into the `wasp-codemod` repo dir, run `npm install` in it and then `npm run imports-0-11 -- <path-to-your-wasp-project-src-dir>` (e.g. `npm run imports-0-11 -- ../foo/src`). When it is done, we suggest checking the changes it did, in case some kind of manual intervention is needed.

   **NOTE:** Running this command will modify your JS/TS files in place!
   
   Alternatively, you can find all the mappings of old imports to the new ones in [this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW-_16KRGTOaKXx9NYUtjk6m2TQ0nUMOA74hBthTH3g/edit#gid=1725669920) and use it to fix some/all of them manually.
9. Replace the Wasp file in `foo` (i.e., `main.wasp`) with the Wasp file from `foo_old`
10. Change the Wasp version field in your Wasp file (now residing in `foo`) to `"^0.12.0"`.
11. Correct external imports in your Wasp file (now residing in `foo`).
    imports. You can do this by running search-and-replace inside the file:

    - Change all occurences of `@server` to `@src/server`
    - Change all occurences of `@client` to `@src/client`

    For example, if you previously had something like:

    ```js
    page LoginPage {
      // highlight-next-line
      // This previously resolved to src/client/LoginPage.js
      // highlight-next-line
      component: import Login from "@client/LoginPage"
    }

    // ...

    query getTasks {
      // highlight-next-line
      // This previously resolved to src/server/queries.js
      // highlight-next-line
      fn: import { getTasks } from "@server/queries.js",
    }
    ```

    You should change it to:

    ```js
    page LoginPage {
      // highlight-next-line
      // This now resolves to src/client/LoginPage.js
      // highlight-next-line
      component: import Login from "@src/client/LoginPage"
    }

    // ...

    query getTasks {
      // highlight-next-line
      // This now resolves to src/server/queries.js
      // highlight-next-line
      fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/server/queries.js",
    }
    ```

    Do this for all external imports in your `.wasp` file. After you're done, there shouldn't be any occurences of strings `"@server"` or `"@client"`

12. Take all the dependencies from `app.dependencies` declaration in
    `foo/main.wasp` and move them to `foo/package.json`. Make sure to remove the `app.dependencies` field from `foo/main.wasp`.

    For example, if `foo_old/main.waps` had:

    ```css
    app Foo {
      // ...
      dependencies: [ ('redux', '^4.0.5'), ('reacjt-redux', '^7.1.3')];
    }
    ```

    Your `package.json` in `foo` should now list these dependencies (Wasp already generated most of the file, you just have to list additional dependencies).

    ```json
    {
      "name": "foo",
      "dependencies": {
        "wasp": "file:.wasp/out/sdk/wasp",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        // highlight-next-line
        "redux": "^4.0.5",
        // highlight-next-line
        "reactjs-redux": "^7.1.3"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "typescript": "^5.1.0",
        "vite": "^4.3.9",
        "@types/react": "^18.0.37",
        "prisma": "4.16.2"
      }
    }
    ```

13. Copy all lines you might have added to `foo_old/.gitignore` into
    `foo/.gitignore`
14. Copy the rest of the top-level files and folders (excluding `gitignore` and the `.wasp`
    file) in `foo_old/` into `foo/` (overwrite the existing files in `foo`).
15. Run `wasp clean`.

That's it! You now have a properly structured Wasp 0.12.0 project in the `foo` directory.
Your app probably doesn't quite work yet due to the breaking changes in Auth.

No worries, just keep reading and we'll take care of those in the next section.
After you migrate your auth logic, we recommend reorganizing the `src` folder as
you see fit.

:::tip

As mentioned, Wasp no longer enforces separation between server-side and
client-side source code.

You can organize source files inside the `src` directory however you want! We
recommend a feature-based organization. Read more about this in [the last section](#next-steps).

:::

### Migrating auth
As shown in [the previous section](#new-auth), Wasp significantly changed how authentication works in version 0.12.0.
This section leads you through migrating your app from Wasp 0.11.X to Wasp 0.12.X.

Migrating your existing app to the new auth system is a two-step process:

1. Migrate to the new auth system
1. Clean up the old auth system

:::info Migrating a deployed app

While going through these steps, we will focus first on doing the changes locally and your local development database.

Once we confirm everything works well locally, we will apply the same changes to the deployed app.

**We'll put extra info for migrating a deployed app in a box like this one.**
:::

#### 1. Migrate to the New Auth System

You can follow these steps to migrate to the new auth system:

1. Upgrade Wasp to the latest 0.12.X version (as described [above](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX)).


1. Bump the version to `^0.12.0` in `main.wasp` (if you haven't already done this when [migrating the app to the new structure](#migrating-your-project-to-the-new-structure)).
1. Create the new auth tables in the database by running:

   ```bash
   wasp db migrate-dev
   ```

You should see the new `Auth`, `AuthIdentity` and `Session` tables in your database. You can use the `wasp db studio` command to open the database in a GUI and verify the tables are there.

1. Write your data migration function(s) in `src/migrateToNewAuth.ts`
    - In the previous step, we migrated the schema, and now we need to prepare logic for migrating the data.
    - Below you can find [examples of migration functions](#example-migration-functions) for each of the auth methods. They should be fine to use as-is, meaning you can just copy them, but you can also modify them to your needs. You will want to have one function per each auth method that you use in your app.
1. Add the migration function(s) to the `db.seeds` config:
  ```wasp title="main.wasp"
  app myApp {
    wasp: {
      version: "^0.12.0"
    },
    // ...
    db: {
      seeds: [
        import { migrateEmailAuth } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth.js",
        import { migrateGoogleAuth } from "@src/migrateToNewAuth.js",
      ]
    },
  }

1. Run the migration function(s) by running:
  ```bash
  wasp db seed
  ```
  If you added multiple migration functions, you can pick which one to run by selecting it from the list.

1. Verify that the auth still works by logging in with each of the auth methods.
1. Update your JS code to work correctly with the new auth entities.

  You should use the new auth helper functions to get the `email` or `username` from a user object. Read more about the helpers in the [Auth Entities](./entities#accessing-the-auth-fields) section.   The helpers you are most likely to use are the `getEmail` and `getUsername` helpers.
1. Finally, check that your app now works as it worked before. If the above steps were done correctly, everything should be working now.

    :::info Migrating a deployed app
    
    After successfully performing migration locally so far, and verifying the your app works as expected, it is time to also migrate our deployed app.
    
    Before migrating your production (deployed) app, we advise you to back up your production database in case something goes wrong. Also, besides testing it in development, it's good to test the migration in a staging environment.
    
    We will perform the production migration in 2 steps:
    - Deploying the new code to production (client and server).
    - Migrating the production database.

    ---
    
    Between these two steps, so after deploying the new code to production and before migrating the production database, your app will not be working completely: new users will be able to sign up, but existing users won't be able to log in, and already logged in users will be logged out. Once you do the second step, migrating the production database, it will all be back to normal.

    You will likely want to keep the time between the two steps as short as you can. Make sure you know exactly what each step means before doing them for real to eliminate any surprises.

    ---
    
    - **First step:** deploy the new code (client and server), either via `wasp deploy` or manually.
    
      Check our [Deployment docs](../advanced/deployment/overview.md) for more details. 

    - **Second step:** run the migration script on the production database with `wasp db seed` command.
    
      We wrote instructions on how to do it for **Fly.io** deployments here: https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/1464 . The instructions should be similar for other deployment providers: setting up some sort of an SSH tunnel from your local machine to the production database and running the migration script locally with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the production database.
    
    Your deployed app should be working normally now, with the new auth system.
    :::


#### 2. Cleanup the Old Auth System

Your app should be working correctly and using new auth, but to finish the migration, we need to clean up the old auth system:

1. Delete auth-related fields from `User` entity.

    - This means any fields that were used for authentication, like `email`, `password`, `isEmailVerified`, `emailVerificationSentAt`, `passwordResetSentAt`, `username`, etc.

1. Remove the `externalAuthEntity` from the `auth` config and the `SocialLogin` entity if you used Google or GitHub auth.
1. Run `wasp db migrate-dev` again to remove the redundant fields from the database.
1. You can now delete the migration script and the `db.seeds` config.

:::info Migrating a deployed app

  After doing the steps above successfully locally and making sure everything is working, it is time to push these changes to the deployed app again.
  
  _Deploy the app again_, either via `wasp deploy` or manually. Check our [Deployment docs](../advanced/deployment/overview.md) for more details. 
  
  The database migrations will automatically run on successful deployment of the server and delete the now redundant auth-related `User` columns from the database. 
  
  Your app is now fully migrated to the new auth system.

:::


#### Example Migration Functions

The migration functions provided below are written with the typical use cases in mind and you can use them as-is. If your setup requires additional logic, you can use them as a good starting point and modify them to your needs.

##### Username & Password

```ts title="src/migrateToNewAuth.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { ProviderName, UsernameProviderData } from "wasp/server/auth";

export async function migrateUsernameAuth(prismaClient: PrismaClient) {
  const users = await prismaClient.user.findMany({
    include: {
      auth: true,
    },
  });

  for (const user of users) {
    if (user.auth) {
      console.log("User was already migrated, skipping", user);
      continue;
    }

    if (!user.username || !user.password) {
      console.log("Missing username auth info, skipping user", user);
      continue;
    }

    const providerData: UsernameProviderData = {
      hashedPassword: user.password,
    };
    const providerName: ProviderName = "username";

    await prismaClient.auth.create({
      data: {
        identities: {
          create: {
            providerName,
            providerUserId: user.username.toLowerCase(),
            providerData: JSON.stringify(providerData),
          },
        },
        user: {
          connect: {
            id: user.id,
          },
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```


##### Email

```ts title="src/migrateToNewAuth.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { EmailProviderData, ProviderName } from "wasp/server/auth";

export async function migrateEmailAuth(prismaClient: PrismaClient) {
  const users = await prismaClient.user.findMany({
    include: {
      auth: true,
    },
  });

  for (const user of users) {
    if (user.auth) {
      console.log("User was already migrated, skipping", user);
      continue;
    }

    if (!user.email || !user.password) {
      console.log("Missing email auth info, skipping user", user);
      continue;
    }

    const providerData: EmailProviderData = {
      isEmailVerified: user.isEmailVerified,
      emailVerificationSentAt:
        user.emailVerificationSentAt?.toISOString() ?? null,
      passwordResetSentAt: user.passwordResetSentAt?.toISOString() ?? null,
      hashedPassword: user.password,
    };
    const providerName: ProviderName = "email";

    await prismaClient.auth.create({
      data: {
        identities: {
          create: {
            providerName,
            providerUserId: user.email,
            providerData: JSON.stringify(providerData),
          },
        },
        user: {
          connect: {
            id: user.id,
          },
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```


##### Google & GitHub

```ts title="src/migrateToNewAuth.ts"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { ProviderName } from "wasp/server/auth";

export async function migrateGoogleAuth(prismaClient: PrismaClient) {
  return createSocialLoginMigration(prismaClient, "google");
}

export async function migrateGitHubAuth(prismaClient: PrismaClient) {
  return createSocialLoginMigration(prismaClient, "github");
}

async function createSocialLoginMigration(
  prismaClient: PrismaClient,
  providerName: "google" | "github"
) {
  const users = await prismaClient.user.findMany({
    include: {
      auth: true,
      externalAuthAssociations: true,
    },
  });

  for (const user of users) {
    if (user.auth) {
      console.log("User was already migrated, skipping", user);
      continue;
    }

    const provider = user.externalAuthAssociations.find(
      (provider) => provider.provider === providerName
    );

    if (!provider) {
      console.log(`Missing ${providerName} provider, skipping user`, user);
      continue;
    }

    await prismaClient.auth.create({
      data: {
        identities: {
          create: {
            providerName,
            providerUserId: provider.providerId,
            providerData: JSON.stringify({}),
          },
        },
        user: {
          connect: {
            id: user.id,
          },
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Next steps

If you made it this far, you've completed all the necessary steps to get your
Wasp app working with Wasp 0.12.x. Nice work!

Finally, since Wasp no longer requires you to separate your client source files
(previously in `src/client`) from server source files (previously in
`src/server`), you are now free to reorganize your project however you think is best.

This section is optional, but if you didn't like the server/client
separation, now's the perfect time to change it!

For example, if your `src` dir looked like this:

```
src
│
├── client
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Login.tsx
│   ├── MainPage.tsx
│   ├── Register.tsx
│   ├── Task.css
│   ├── TaskLisk.tsx
│   ├── Task.tsx
│   └── User.tsx
├── server
│   ├── taskActions.ts
│   ├── taskQueries.ts
│   ├── userActions.ts
│   └── userQueries.ts
└── shared
    └── utils.ts
```

You can now change it to something like this (or something else, as long as you
keep all source files in the `src` directory):

```
src
│
├── task
│   ├── actions.ts    -- former taskActions.ts
│   ├── queries.ts    -- former taskQueries.ts
│   ├── Task.css
│   ├── TaskLisk.tsx
│   └── Task.tsx
├── user
│   ├── actions.ts    -- former userActions.ts
│   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   ├── Login.tsx
│   ├── queries.ts    -- former userQueries.ts
│   ├── Register.tsx
│   └── User.tsx
├── MainPage.tsx
└── utils.ts
```
