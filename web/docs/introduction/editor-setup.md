Wasp comes with the Wasp language server, which gives supported editors powerful support and integration with the language.

## VSCode

Currently, Wasp only supports integration with VSCode. Install the [Wasp language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp) to get syntax highlighting and integration with the Wasp language server.

The extension enables:

- syntax highlighting for `.wasp` files
- the Prisma extension for `.prisma` files
- scaffolding of new project files
- code completion
- diagnostics (errors and warnings)
- go to definition

and more!
