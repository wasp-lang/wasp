We did it! For all those that followed the instructions closely and created "Build a Todo App in Wasp" task in our Todo App, let's celebrate by marking it as done :)!

<img alt="Yay we are done with the Todo App tutorial!"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-tutorial-end.gif')}
     style={{ border: '1px solid black' }}
/>

You can check out the whole code of the app that we just built [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/tutorials/TodoApp).

If you are interested in what is Wasp actually generating in the background, you can check the `.wasp/out/` directory in your project.

## Tailwind CSS Support

Wasp supports Tailwind out of the box! 🎨 If you want to style your app with sweet Tailwind CSS classes, all you have to do is add a couple of config files to your app.

Check out [this guide](/docs/integrations/css-frameworks#tailwind) to learn more!

## What's next?

Well, you could check the **Guides** on the left of the docs for more details on specific parts of Wasp. Maybe something real-time with [WebSockets](/docs/guides/websockets) or with [async jobs](/docs/language/features#jobs)?
Let your imagination run wild and build something of your own! ✨
