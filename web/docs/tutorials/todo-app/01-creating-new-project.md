import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Wasp project:
```shell
wasp new TodoApp
```
Enter the created directory and run:
```shell
cd TodoApp
wasp start
```
You have just run your app in the development mode!

:::note
`wasp start` might take a little bit longer due to the initial setup.

You will be seeing a lot of different output from the client, server and database setting themselves up.
Once ready, a new tab should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`, with a simple placeholder page:

<img alt="Screenshot of new Wasp app"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/wasp-new-screenshot.png')}
     style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
     height="400px"
/>

We just set the foundations of our app! We don't have yet the features to show it, but Wasp has already generated for us the full front-end and back-end code of the app. Take a peek at `TodoApp/.wasp/out` if you are curious and want to see what it looks like!

## Taking a closer look at the code

Let's inspect the Wasp project we just created:
```bash
.
├── .gitignore
├── main.wasp             # Your wasp code goes here.
├── src
│   ├── client            # Your client code (JS/CSS/HTML) goes here.
│   │   ├── Main.css
│   │   ├── MainPage.jsx
│   │   ├── vite-env.d.ts
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json
│   │   └── waspLogo.png
│   ├── server            # Your server code (Node JS) goes here.
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   ├── shared            # Your shared (runtime independent) code goes here .
│   │   └── tsconfig.json
│   └── .waspignore
└── .wasproot
```
By _your code_, we mean _"the code you write"_ (as opposed to the code generated by Wasp). Wasp expects you to separate all external code into three folders to make it clear which runtime executes what:
- `src/server` - Contains the code executed on the server (i.e., in Node)
- `src/client` - Contains the code executed on the client (i.e., JS in the browser)
- `src/shared` - Contains the code you want to use on both the client and the server (e.g., runtime-independent utility functions)

You may be wondering what about the rest of the generated files (`tsconfig.json`
and `vite-env.d.ts`? Your IDE needs them to improve your development
experience (i.e., autocompletion, intellisense, etc.), so it's best to leave
them alone (for now).

:::note Typescript Support
Wasp supports Typescript out of the box but you are free to use JavaScript (js/jsx)
or TypeScript (ts/tsx) as you see fit, on a file-by-file basis.

For this tutorial, we will simply use vanilla Javascript and JSX syntax 🍦

If you'd prefer to follow along using TypeScript:
 1. Start by changing `MainPage.jsx` to `MainPage.tsx`
 2. For the rest of the tutorial, you can write TypeScript whereever you see fit. Just make sure to use the appropriate extensions.

No extra configuration is needed!

We'll provide you with both JavaScript and TypeScript snippets for each feature we cover.

To see how to get the most out of Wasp and TypeScript, take a look at [our
TypeScript doc](/docs/typescript). It contains a list of all TypeScript features
Wasp currently supports.
:::

Let's start with the `main.wasp` file, which introduces 3 new concepts:
[app](language/features.md#app),
[page](language/features.md#page) and
[route](language/features.md#route).

<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app TodoApp { // Main declaration, defines a new web app.
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.11.0"
  },
  title: "Todo app" // Used as a browser tab title.
}

route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage } // Render page MainPage on url `/` (default url).

page MainPage {
  // We specify that ReactJS implementation of our page can be found in
  // `src/client/MainPage.jsx` as a default export (uses standard js import syntax).
  // Use '@client' to reference files inside the src/client folder.
  component: import Main from "@client/MainPage.jsx"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app TodoApp { // Main declaration, defines a new web app.
  wasp: {
    version: "^0.11.0"
  },
  title: "Todo app" // Used as a browser tab title.
}

route RootRoute { path: "/", to: MainPage } // Render page MainPage on url `/` (default url).

page MainPage {
  // We specify that ReactJS implementation of our page can be found in
  // `src/client/MainPage.tsx` as a default export (uses standard js import syntax).
  // Use '@client' to reference files inside the src/client folder.
  component: import Main from "@client/MainPage.tsx"
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's now take a look at that React component we referenced in the `page MainPage { ... }` declaration in `main.wasp`:
<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx title="src/client/MainPage.jsx"
import waspLogo from './waspLogo.png'
import './Main.css'

const MainPage = () => {
  ...
}
export default MainPage
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx title="src/client/MainPage.tsx"
import waspLogo from './waspLogo.png'
import './Main.css'

const MainPage = () => {
  ...
}
export default MainPage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As we can see, this is simply a functional React component that uses the CSS and Wasp logo files sitting next to it in the `src/client` dir.

This is all the code we need!
Wasp quietly takes care of everything else necessary to define, build, and run a web app.

:::tip
`wasp start` automatically picks up the changes you make and restarts the app, so keep it running.
:::

## Cleaning up

Let's make our first changes!

To prepare the clean slate for building the TodoApp, delete the files `Main.css`
and `waspLogo.png` from the `src/client/` folder (`src/shared` and `src/server`
are already clean). Wasp needs the `tsconfig.json` and `vite-env.d.ts` for
IDE support, so it's important to keep them.

Next, let's make the `MainPage` component much simpler:


<Tabs groupId="js-ts">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```jsx title="src/client/MainPage.jsx"
const MainPage = () => {
  return <div> Hello world! </div>
}

export default MainPage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```tsx title="src/client/MainPage.tsx"
const MainPage = () => {
  return <div> Hello world! </div>
}

export default MainPage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this point, you should see something like this:

<img alt="Todo App - Hello World"
     src={useBaseUrl('img/todo-app-hello-world.png')}
     style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}
/>

Ok, time to take the next step - implementing some real Todo app features!
