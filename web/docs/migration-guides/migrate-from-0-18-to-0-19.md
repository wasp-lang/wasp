title: Migration from 0.18.X to 0.19.X
---

## What's new in 0.19.0?

### Wasp now uses npm workspaces

Wasp now enables npm workspaces for managing the generated app. This change makes our dependency system more reliable, and better prepares us for future features. It also makes installs faster overall and reduces the size of each project on your disk. This is largely transparent, and you shouldn't notice any difference in how you develop your app.

## How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.18.X to 0.19.X, follow these steps:

### 1. Bump the Wasp version

Update the version field in your Wasp file to `^0.19.0`:

```wasp title="main.wasp"
app MyApp {
  wasp: {
    // highlight-next-line
    version: "^0.19.0"
  },
}
```

### 2. Add the `workspaces` key to your `package.json`

Add the following key to your `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "workspaces": [".wasp/build/*", ".wasp/out/*"]
}
```

And, to recalculate the dependencies with the new workspace setup, run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
wasp clean
rm package-lock.json
wasp ts-setup # ONLY if you are using the Wasp TS Config
```

### 3. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!
