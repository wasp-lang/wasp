## What's new in 0.18.0?

## How to migrate?

To migrate your Wasp app from 0.17.X to 0.18.X, follow these steps:

### 1. Check your compatibility with Vite 7

Wasp now uses Vite 7 for better performance and stability. This includes some breaking changes, but we don't expect Wasp apps to be affected by them. If you are using Vite features directly in your app, you should check the migration guides for [Vite 5](https://v5.vite.dev/guide/migration.html), [Vite 6](https://v6.vite.dev/guide/migration.html), and [Vite 7](https://v7.vite.dev/guide/migration.html). We expect most Wasp apps to be unaffected by these changes.

### 2. Enjoy your updated Wasp app

That's it!

You should now be able to run your app with the new Wasp 0.18.0.
