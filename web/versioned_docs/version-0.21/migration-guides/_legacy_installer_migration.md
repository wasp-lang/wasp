:::important New installation method

Wasp is now installed as a global npm package, instead of the old custom installer. To start using the new installation method, you can run our migration tool:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh -s -- migrate-to-npm
```

You can read more about it in the **[Legacy installer guide](../guides/legacy/installer.md)**.
