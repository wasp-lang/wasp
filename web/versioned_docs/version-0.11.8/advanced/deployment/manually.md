We'll cover how to deploy your Wasp app manually to a variety of providers:

- [Fly.io](#flyio)
- [Netlify](#netlify)
- [Railway](#railway)
- [Heroku](#heroku)

## Deploying a Wasp App

Deploying a Wasp app comes down to the following:

1. Generating deployable code.
1. Deploying the API server (backend).
1. Deploying the web client (frontend).
1. Deploying a PostgreSQL database and keeping it running.

Let's go through each of these steps.

### 1. Generating Deployable Code

Running the command `wasp build` generates deployable code for the whole app in the `.wasp/build/` directory.

```
wasp build
```

:::caution PostgreSQL in production
You won't be able to build the app if you are using SQLite as a database (which is the default database).
You'll have to [switch to PostgreSQL](/docs/data-model/backends#migrating-from-sqlite-to-postgresql) before deploying to production.
:::

### 2. Deploying the API Server (backend)

There's a Dockerfile that defines an image for building the server in the `.wasp/build` directory.

To run the server in production, deploy this Docker image to a hosting provider and ensure it has access to correct environment variables (this varies depending on the provider).
All necessary environment variables are listed in the next section.

#### Environment Variables

Here are the environment variables your server requires to run:

- `PORT`

  The server's HTTP port number. This is where the server listens for requests (e.g., `3001`).

- `DATABASE_URL`

  The URL of the Postgres database you want your app to use (e.g., `postgresql://mydbuser:mypass@localhost:5432/nameofmydb`).

- `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL`

  The URL where you plan to deploy your frontend app is running (e.g., `https://<app-name>.netlify.app`).
  The server needs to know about it to properly configure Same-Origin Policy (CORS) headers.

- `JWT_SECRET`

  You only need this environment variable if you're using Wasp's `auth` features.
  Set it to a random string at least 32 characters long (you can use an [online generator](https://djecrety.ir/)).

<AddExternalAuthEnvVarsReminder />

### 3. Deploying the Web Client (frontend)

<BuildingTheWebClient />

The command above will build the web client and put it in the `build/` directory in the `web-app` directory.

Since the app's frontend is just a bunch of static files, you can deploy it to any static hosting provider.

### 4. Deploying the Database

Any PostgreSQL database will do, as long as you set the `DATABASE_URL` env var correctly and ensure that the database is accessible from the server.

## Different Providers

We'll cover a few different deployment providers below:

- Fly.io (server and database)
- Netlify (client)
- Railway (server, client and database)
- Heroku (server and database)

## Fly.io

:::tip We automated this process for you
If you want to do all of the work below with one command, you can use the [Wasp CLI](/docs/advanced/deployment/cli#flyio).

Wasp CLI deploys the server, deploys the client, and sets up a database.
It also gives you a way to redeploy (update) your app with a single command.
:::

Fly.io offers a variety of free services that are perfect for deploying your first Wasp app! You will need a Fly.io account and the [`flyctl` CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/).

:::note
Fly.io offers support for both locally built Docker containers and remotely built ones. However, for simplicity and reproducibility, we will default to the use of a remote Fly.io builder.

Additionally, `fly` is a symlink for `flyctl` on most systems and they can be used interchangeably.
:::

Make sure you are logged in with `flyctl` CLI. You can check if you are logged in with `flyctl auth whoami`, and if you are not, you can log in with `flyctl auth login`.

### Set Up a Fly.io App

:::info
You need to do this only once per Wasp app.
:::

Unless you already have a Fly.io app that you want to deploy to, let's create a new Fly.io app.

After you have [built the app](#1-generating-deployable-code), position yourself in `.wasp/build/` directory:

```shell
cd .wasp/build
```

Next, run the launch command to set up a new app and create a `fly.toml` file:

```bash
flyctl launch --remote-only
```

This will ask you a series of questions, such as asking you to choose a region and whether you'd like a database.

- Say **yes** to **Would you like to set up a Postgresql database now?** and select **Development**. Fly.io will set a `DATABASE_URL` for you.
- Say **no** to **Would you like to deploy now?** (and to any additional questions).

  We still need to set up several environment variables.

:::info What if the database setup fails?
If your attempts to initiate a new app fail for whatever reason, then you should run `flyctl apps destroy <app-name>` before trying again. Fly does not allow you to create multiple apps with the same name.

<details>
  <summary>
    What does it look like when your DB is deployed correctly?

    <p>When your DB is deployed correctly, you'll see it in the <a href="https://fly.io/dashboard">Fly.io dashboard</a>:</p>
    <img width="662" alt="image" src="/img/deploying/fly-db.png" />
  </div>
</details>
:::
  
Next, let's copy the `fly.toml` file up to our Wasp project dir for safekeeping.
```shell
cp fly.toml ../../
```

Next, let's add a few more environment variables:

```bash
flyctl secrets set PORT=8080
flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET=<random_string_at_least_32_characters_long>
flyctl secrets set WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_where_frontend_will_be_deployed>
```

:::note
If you do not know what your frontend URL is yet, don't worry. You can set `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` after you deploy your frontend.
:::

<AddExternalAuthEnvVarsReminder />

If you want to make sure you've added your secrets correctly, run `flyctl secrets list` in the terminal. Note that you will see hashed versions of your secrets to protect your sensitive data.

### Deploy to a Fly.io App

While still in the `.wasp/build/` directory, run:

```bash
flyctl deploy --remote-only --config ../../fly.toml
```

This will build and deploy the backend of your Wasp app on Fly.io to `https://<app-name>.fly.dev` 🤘🎸

Now, if you haven't, you can deploy your frontend and add the client url by running `flyctl secrets set WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_deployed_frontend>`. We suggest using [Netlify](#netlify) for your frontend, but you can use any static hosting provider.

Additionally, some useful `flyctl` commands:

```bash
flyctl logs
flyctl secrets list
flyctl ssh console
```

### Redeploying After Wasp Builds

When you rebuild your Wasp app (with `wasp build`), it will remove your `.wasp/build/` directory. In there, you may have a `fly.toml` from any prior Fly.io deployments.

While we will improve this process in the future, in the meantime, you have a few options:

1. Copy the `fly.toml` file to a versioned directory, like your Wasp project dir.

  From there, you can reference it in `flyctl deploy --config <path>` commands, like above.

1. Backup the `fly.toml` file somewhere before running `wasp build`, and copy it into .wasp/build/ after.

  When the `fly.toml` file exists in .wasp/build/ dir, you do not need to specify the `--config <path>`.

1. Run `flyctl config save -a <app-name>` to regenerate the `fly.toml` file from the remote state stored in Fly.io.

## Netlify

Netlify is a static hosting solution that is free for many use cases. You will need a Netlify account and [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed to follow these instructions.

Make sure you are logged in with Netlify CLI. You can check if you are logged in with `netlify status`, and if you are not, you can log in with `netlify login`.

First, make sure you have [built the Wasp app](#1-generating-deployable-code). We'll build the client web app next.

<BuildingTheWebClient />

We can now deploy the client with:

```shell
netlify deploy
```

<small>

Carefully follow the instructions i.e. do you want to create a new app or use an existing one, the team under which your app will reside etc.

</small>

The final step is to run:

```shell
netlify deploy --prod`
```

That is it! Your client should be live at `https://<app-name>.netlify.app` ✨

:::note
Make sure you set this URL as the `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` environment variable in your server hosting environment (e.g., Fly.io or Heroku).

## Railway

Railway is a simple and great way to host your server and database. It's also possible to deploy your entire app: database, server, and client. You can use the platform for free for a limited time, or if you meet certain eligibility requirements. See their [plans page](https://docs.railway.app/reference/plans) for more info.

### Prerequisites

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your Wasp app is built by running `wasp build` in the project dir.
2. Create a [Railway](https://railway.app/) account

  :::tip Free Tier
  Sign up with your GitHub account to be eligible for the free tier
  :::

3. Install the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#installation)
4. Run `railway login` and a browser tab will open to authenticate you.

### Create New Project

Let's create our Railway project:

1. Go to your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard), click on **New Project**, and select `Provision PostgreSQL` from the dropdown menu.
2. Once it initializes, right-click on the **New** button in the top right corner and select **Empty Service**.
3. Once it initializes, click on it, go to **Settings > General** and change the name to `server`
4. Go ahead and create another empty service and name it `client`

![Changing the name](/img/deploying/railway-rename.png)

### Deploy Your App to Railway

#### Setup Domains

We'll need the domains for both the `server` and `client` services:

1. Go to the `server` instance's `Settings` tab, and click `Generate Domain`.
2. Do the same under the `client`'s `Settings`.

Copy the domains as we will need them later.

#### Deploying the Server

Let's deploy our server first:

1. Move into your app's `.wasp/build/` directory:

  ```shell
  cd .wasp/build
  ```

2. Link your app build to your newly created Railway project:

  ```shell
  railway link
  ```

3. Go into the Railway dashboard and set up the required env variables:

   Open the `Settings` and go to the `Variables` tab:

   - click **Variable reference** and select `DATABASE_URL` (it will populate it with the correct value)
   - add `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` - enter the the `client` domain (e.g. `https://client-production-XXXX.up.railway.app`)
   - add `JWT_SECRET` - enter a random string at least 32 characters long (use an [online generator](https://djecrety.ir/))

     <AddExternalAuthEnvVarsReminder />

4. Push and deploy the project:

```shell
railway up
```

Select `server` when prompted with `Select Service`.

Railway will now locate the Dockerfile and deploy your server 👍

#### Deploying the Client

1. Next, change into your app's frontend build directory `.wasp/build/web-app`:

  ```shell
  cd web-app
  ```

2. Create the production build, using the `server` domain as the `REACT_APP_API_URL`:

  ```shell
  npm install && REACT_APP_API_URL=<url_to_wasp_backend> npm run build
  ```

3. Next, we want to link this specific frontend directory to our project as well:

  ```shell
  railway link
  ```

4. We need to configure Railway's static hosting for our client.

   :::info Setting Up Static Hosting

   Copy the `build` folder within the `web-app` directory to `dist`:

   ```shell
   cp -r build dist
   ```

   We'll need to create the following files:

   - `Dockerfile` with:

     ```Dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
     FROM pierrezemb/gostatic
     CMD [ "-fallback", "index.html" ]
     COPY ./dist/ /srv/http/
     ```

   - `.dockerignore` with:
     ```bash title=".dockerignore"
     node_modules/
     ```

   You'll need to repeat these steps **each time** you run `wasp build` as it will remove the `.wasp/build/web-app` directory.

   <details>
   <summary>
   Here's a useful shell script to do the process
   </summary>

   If you want to automate the process, save the following as `deploy_client.sh` in the root of your project:

   ```bash title="deploy_client.sh"
   #!/usr/bin/env bash

   if [ -z "$REACT_APP_API_URL" ]
   then
     echo "REACT_APP_API_URL is not set"
     exit 1
   fi

   wasp build
   cd .wasp/build/web-app

   npm install && REACT_APP_API_URL=$REACT_APP_API_URL npm run build

   cp -r build dist

   dockerfile_contents=$(cat <<EOF
   FROM pierrezemb/gostatic
   CMD [ "-fallback", "index.html" ]
   COPY ./dist/ /srv/http/
   EOF
   )

   dockerignore_contents=$(cat <<EOF
   node_modules/
   EOF
   )

   echo "$dockerfile_contents" > Dockerfile
   echo "$dockerignore_contents" > .dockerignore

   railway up
   ```

   Make it executable with:

   ```shell
   chmod +x deploy_client.sh
   ```

   You can run it with:

   ```shell
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<url_to_wasp_backend> ./deploy_client.sh
   ```

   </details>
   :::

5. Set the `PORT` environment variable to `8043` under the `Variables` tab.

6. Deploy the client and select `client` when prompted with `Select Service`:

```shell
railway up
```

#### Conclusion

And now your Wasp should be deployed! 🐝 🚂 🚀

Back in your [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard), click on your project and you should see your newly deployed services: Postgres, Server, and Client.

### Updates & Redeploying

When you make updates and need to redeploy:

- run `wasp build` to rebuild your app
- run `railway up` in the `.wasp/build` directory (server)
- repeat all the steps in the `.wasp/build/web-app` directory (client)

## Heroku

:::note
Heroku used to offer free apps under certain limits. However, as of November 28, 2022, they ended support for their free tier. https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter

As such, we recommend using an alternative provider like [Fly.io](#flyio) for your first apps.
:::

You will need Heroku account, `heroku` [CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and `docker` CLI installed to follow these instructions.

Make sure you are logged in with `heroku` CLI. You can check if you are logged in with `heroku whoami`, and if you are not, you can log in with `heroku login`.

### Set Up a Heroku App

:::info
You need to do this only once per Wasp app.
:::

Unless you want to deploy to an existing Heroku app, let's create a new Heroku app:

```
heroku create <app-name>
```

Unless you have an external Postgres database that you want to use, let's create a new database on Heroku and attach it to our app:

```
heroku addons:create --app <app-name> heroku-postgresql:mini
```

:::caution
Heroku does not offer a free plan anymore and `mini` is their cheapest database instance - it costs $5/mo.
:::

Heroku will also set `DATABASE_URL` env var for us at this point. If you are using an external database, you will have to set it up yourself.

The `PORT` env var will also be provided by Heroku, so the only two left to set are the `JWT_SECRET` and `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` env vars:

```
heroku config:set --app <app-name> JWT_SECRET=<random_string_at_least_32_characters_long>
heroku config:set --app <app-name> WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=<url_of_where_frontend_will_be_deployed>
```

:::note
If you do not know what your frontend URL is yet, don't worry. You can set `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL` after you deploy your frontend.
:::

### Deploy to a Heroku App

After you have [built the app](#1-generating-deployable-code), position yourself in `.wasp/build/` directory:

```shell
cd .wasp/build
```

assuming you were at the root of your Wasp project at that moment.

Log in to Heroku Container Registry:

```shell
heroku container:login
```

Build the docker image and push it to Heroku:

```shell
heroku container:push --app <app-name> web
```

App is still not deployed at this point.
This step might take some time, especially the very first time, since there are no cached docker layers.

:::note Note for Apple Silicon Users
Apple Silicon users need to build a non-Arm image, so the above step will not work at this time. Instead of `heroku container:push`, users instead should:

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t <app-name> .
docker tag <app-name> registry.heroku.com/<app-name>/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/<app-name>/web
```

You are now ready to proceed to the next step.
:::

Deploy the pushed image and restart the app:

```shell
heroku container:release --app <app-name> web
```

This is it, the backend is deployed at `https://<app-name>-XXXX.herokuapp.com` 🎉

Find out the exact app URL with:

```shell
heroku info --app <app-name>
```

Additionally, you can check out the logs with:

```shell
heroku logs --tail --app <app-name>
```

:::note Using `pg-boss` with Heroku

If you wish to deploy an app leveraging [Jobs](/docs/advanced/jobs) that use `pg-boss` as the executor to Heroku, you need to set an additional environment variable called `PG_BOSS_NEW_OPTIONS` to `{"connectionString":"<REGULAR_HEROKU_DATABASE_URL>","ssl":{"rejectUnauthorized":false}}`. This is because pg-boss uses the `pg` extension, which does not seem to connect to Heroku over SSL by default, which Heroku requires. Additionally, Heroku uses a self-signed cert, so we must handle that as well.
