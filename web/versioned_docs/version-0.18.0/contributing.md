Any way you want to contribute is a good way, and we'd be happy to meet you! A single entry point for all contributors is the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in our Github repo. All the requirements and instructions are there, so please check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

Some side notes to make your journey easier:

1. Join us on <DiscordLink /> and let's talk! We can discuss language design, new/existing features, and weather, or you can tell us how you feel about Wasp :).

2. Wasp's compiler is built with Haskell. That means you'll need to be somewhat familiar with this language if you'd like to contribute to the compiler itself. But Haskell is just a part of Wasp, and you can contribute to lot of parts that require web dev skills, either by coding or by suggesting how to improve Wasp and its design as a web framework. If you don't have Haskell knowledge (or any dev experience at all) - no problem. There are a lot of JS-related tasks and documentation updates as well!

3. If there's something you'd like to bring to our attention, go to [docs GitHub repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and make an issue/PR!

Happy hacking!
