    text: "When I first learned about Wasp on HN I was really excited about its DSL approach. It was amazing how fast I could get things running with Wasp - I had the first version within an hour! The language is also fairly simple and straightforward and plays well with React & Node.js + it removes a ton of boilerplate.\n\nI've used Wasp for a lot of personal projects and for some small utility tools at various workplaces. I'm looking forward to what Wasp will bring and mean not only for rapid prototyping but also for removing the friction of getting something going in the first instance, it'll save a lot of people a lot of time!",

I‚Äôve done plenty of hackathons before where I‚Äôve built small SaaS apps, and there‚Äôs just so much time wasted setting up common utilities - stuff like user management, databases, routing, etc. Wasp handled all that for me and let me build out our web app in record time.\n\nAlso, deploying the wasp app was incredibly easy - I didn‚Äôt have time to stand up full infrastructure in the 2 day hackathon and don‚Äôt have an infra/devops background, but I had something running on Netlify within an hour. Other projects at the hackathon struggled to do this, and putting access in the hands of the judges certainly helped get us 1st place.\n\n@matijash @martin_sosic keep up the great work.',
