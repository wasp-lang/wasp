    question: 'How is Wasp different from Next.js / Nuxt.js / Gatsby?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        <strong>TL;DR</strong> - These are frontend-first frameworks, with some
        limited backend capabilities. Wasp is a full-stack framework.
        <br />
        <br />
        The main difference between Wasp and the solutions listed above is that
        Wasp is a trully full-stack framework, meaning it brings both back-end
        and database next to front-end. You can think of it as Ruby on Rails,
        but made for JS (React & Node.js) and full-stack.
        <br />
        <br />
        Next.js, Gatsby and others started out as frontend frameworks for static
        sites. Although some of them now offer an option to use serverless
        functions, you still have to bring your own database and you'll also
        need some kind of a server/backend if you'll need to run more complex
        operations.

    question: 'How is Wasp different from Ruby on Rails or Django?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        <strong>TL;DR</strong> - while Ruby on Rails and Django are considered
        full-stack frameworks, they require extra work to support modern
        “desktop” experience that most web apps offer today. Wasp is made
        specifically for that use case and supports it out-of-the-box, with a
        lot of extra niceties that make developer's life easier.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ruby on Rails and Django both fall in the category of full-stack web
        frameworks - they allow you to write backend/server code and also
        generate html/css that gets sent to the client.
        <br />
        <br />
        The main reason why they are often today not used as a standalone
        solution, but rather as an API server combined with frontend libraries
        such as React & Vue, is to add support for the client side manipulation
        of DOM. That’s especially important for web applications with a lot of
        dynamic content (e.g. dashboards) where you want “smooth” experience of
        a desktop app. Imagine expanding a post on Twitter or moving a Trello
        card and suddenly the whole site starts reloading - that's why you need
        React or Vue.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wasp supports this behaviour out-of-the-box, along with all the best
        practices. One of the biggest time savers is automatic sharing of data
        models between the database, frontend and the client - with RoR of
        Django you’d typically have implement a custom API (e.g. rest or
        graphql), while with Wasp you can skip that step in entirety.

    question: 'How hard is it to learn Wasp?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        We measured! <strong>It takes about 30 minutes to get going</strong>,
        and most users find it pretty straight-forward. Since the majority of
        your coding will still be done in the tools you're familiar with
        (currently React & Node.js), it's really a marginal change to what
        you're used to.
        <br />
        <br />
        The reason for that is that Wasp is a really simple configuration
        language, without any loops or variables - you can think of it as a JSON
        that is easier to read and is a bit smarter.
        <br />
        <br />
        Still, although simple (and we plan to keep it that way), it's a real
        language so you get all the IDE goodies with it - syntax highlighting,
        auto-completion, live error reporting, ...
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you support only React & Node.js currently?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes, that is currently the supported stack. But, Wasp is being developed
        as a language/framework and architecture-agnostic tool, so we plan to
        add support for more languages and frameworks in the future.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is something we're pretty excited about and think could be
        potentially be a unique opportunity due to the language approach we're
        taking with Wasp.
