So Launch Week #2 has officially come to an end, and as the tradition goes, the end of the launch week means the beginning of a hackathon! 

We've launched a ton of new features for you to build your Hackathon project with, including:
- <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/04/12/auth-ui">full-stack auth</a>, 
- support for sending emails, 
- the ability to add custom API routes, 
- full-stack type safety,
- <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/04/11/wasp-launch-week-two#thursday-apr-13---deploy-your-app-to-flyio-with-a-single-cli-command">one-line deployment to Fly.io</a>...

You can read all it in this <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/04/11/wasp-launch-week-two"> blog post</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YDqh7dSW8ZQ">1-minute video</a> showing how it all works in practice 🎬!

Even better, we've got a new starter templates feature that lets you create a new project with a pre-built template, so you can get started even faster! Like this sweet <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas">SaaS template</a> with GPT, Stripe, SendGrid, and Tailwind UI already integrated:

/>

Just run `wasp new my-project -t saas` and you're good to go.

The prizes for the hackathon include <b>an awesome Wasp-themed mechanical keyboard, tons of Wasp swag, and more cool stuff</b> (e.g., virtual hugs from the team)!

The only rule is to use Wasp, and you can build whatever you want (but both you and I know it's going to be a GPT-powered app, so make sure to use <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas">our template</a>).

The applications are open, and the hackathon starts on April 28th and ends May 7th. You can apply (solo or with a team) here:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center"}}>
  <a href="https://hackathon.wasp-lang.dev"><span style={{ fontSize: "26px"}}> 🏆 Join the Wasp Hackathon 2.0! 🏆</span></a>
</div>
<br/>

Good luck and Happy Hacking 🐝🚀!
