Aaaand the results are in! After 10 days of intense vibes-fueled creative energy, **we're thrilled to announce the winners of Wasp's first ever Design-AI-thon**.

We have to admit - judging was *tough*. We asked you to reimagine Wasp's website, and you absolutely delivered. Some of you went full Figma wizard mode, others shipped actual working code, and one person even brought in a full vibe-coded OS (more on that later 👀).

Thank you to everyone who participated! Whether you submitted or just followed along, your enthusiasm made this event special. Now, without further ado, let's get to the winners across our three categories: Best Overall Project, Most Fun/Innovative, and Most Technically Impressive.

## Best Overall Project 🥇

**Winner: Zeke**

When we said "no rules," Zeke took it to heart and delivered a complete overhaul of Wasp's visual identity. We're talking full redesign - new layout, refreshed copy, the works. But what really made this submission stand out wasn't just the end result though it looked great, it was the *journey*.

Zeke didn't just drop a Figma file and call it a day. He documented his entire thought process, breaking down every design decision, every copy change, and the reasoning behind it all. He even created 6 different drawings of boi!

The attention to detail combined with the comprehensive approach made this an easy pick for Best Overall Project. Zeke clearly put serious time and energy into understanding what Wasp needed, and it shows.

## Most Fun / Innovative 🎨

**Winner: Étienne Gagnier**

**Figma design**: [link](https://ide-tidy-39147958.figma.site/)

Remember when we said we wanted something you don't see every day? Etienne delivered exactly that. Imagine if Wasp's website was designed like a developer's notebook, complete with that hand-drawn, sketch-style aesthetic.

It's playful, it's memorable, and it's *fun*. In a world where most dev tool websites look like they came from the same template, Etienne's design stands out by leaning into personality over polish. The notebook-style approach feels authentic and creative - like you're peeking into someone's actual design process.

This is the kind of out-of-the-box thinking we were hoping to see. It's a design that makes you smile, and honestly, that's exactly the vibe Wasp is all about (next to building web apps).

## Most Technically Impressive 💻

**Winner: [Adam (bO-05)](https://github.com/bO-05)**

**See it in action**: [link](https://wasp-clone-1.vercel.app)

Remember that vibe-coded OS we mentioned earlier? Yeah, this is it. Adam didn't just redesign Wasp's website - he built an *entire interactive desktop OS playground* where you can explore Wasp like you're using an actual operating system.

We're talking a fully functional virtual desktop complete with file management, a working terminal, notes app, and even an AI-powered chat assistant. Want to save your work? There's optional cloud sync with authentication. Adam literally shipped a whole OS experience for a website redesign competition.

The technical execution here is wild, but what really sealed the deal was how it all comes together with this futuristic, high-vibe aesthetic. It's not just technically impressive - it's *cool*. You could spend 20 minutes just playing around with it, which is exactly what I did.

## Thank You!

A huge thank you to everyone who submitted - the quality and creativity across the board was incredible. It was genuinely tough to narrow it down to just three winners. Each submission brought something special, and we loved seeing how you interpreted Wasp's personality in your own unique way.

## The Prizes

Our three winners will each be receiving one of these beautifully designed pieces of hardware:

- [OB-4 Bluetooth Loudspeaker by teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/store/ob-4-ochre)
- [TRMNL - E-ink companion for your desk](https://usetrmnl.com/)
- [Playdate - A tiny handheld game system. With The Crank.](https://play.date/shop/playdate/)
