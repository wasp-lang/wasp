As promised at the start of this Launch Week, we're bringing our hackathon back! And this time, it's a bit special - **we're asking you to give a revamp to Wasp's website**! Our design is kinda dated and looks like it was done by a backend engineer (looking at myself), and we think it's about time we did something about it!

{/* truncate */}

We want to come up with something *fun* and not what you see every day, which reflects our style and personality.

The only rule is: there are no rules!

## Key things to know
- You have 10 days to **create a redesigned mock-up of [Wasp's website](/)**
  - Starting **10:00 am PT Friday, Oct 10th, 2025**
  - The submission deadline is **11:59 pm Sunday, midnight PT, Oct 19th, 2025**
- Use any tool or format - code, Figma design, drawing. Anything.
- You're welcome to adapt the copy on the website. If you have an idea for a tagline you think would work better (e.g. "Laravel for JS"), we'd love to see it!

You can find Wasp's existing website code and use it as a starting point [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/web/src/pages/index.jsx).

## FAQ
Here are answers to some questions you might have. If there is something we haven't covered, ping us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rzdnErX)!

### What should I create? What level of fidelity should it be?

We leave this part up to you. Whatever you think might be a good way to represent your idea on how to upgrade Wasp's page design and/or branding. It could be a page you actually coded and deployed, a Figma/Illustrator design, a drawing or a video in which you present your vision.

Maybe even a poem. Ok, probably not, but would be interesting to see someone give it a try.

To get your juices flowing, here's an example we played around with internally :

<div className="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5UWX6XkkbL4?si=sQPROo5PGfFWKmn2" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />
</div>

### How much of the website should I mock up?

You can go as far as you want. As a minimum, we recommend focusing on the Above-The-Fold aka Hero section of the page. That is the portion of the page you see on your screen when it loads for the first time, before you scroll down.

### Which tools should I use? Can I use AI?

Of course! As the title says, it's a design-AI-thon. We believe that AI has made better design more accessible to anyone (even backend engineers, although that's a tough one) and would love to see it in action!

You're of course also free to go old-school and do it Figma/Sketch/Photoshop/Illustrator or any other design tool out there.

## Prizes
There are 3 categories, and there will be prizes for:
- Best overall project
- Most fun / innovative
- Most technically impressive

For the prizes themselves, we'll give away three beautifully designed pieces of hardware. We think that is just right for the theme of this competition, and will inspire you to channel your inner Jony Ive or Dieter Rams.

- Prize #1: [OB-4 Bluetooth Loudspeaker by teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/store/ob-4-ochre)
- Prize #2: [TRMNL - E-ink companion for your desk](https://usetrmnl.com/)
- Prize #3: [Playdate - A tiny handheld game system. With The Crank.](https://play.date/shop/playdate/)

Special thanks goes to folks at TRMNL for offering to sponsor this event by gifting a device! Seems like [me tweeting a lot of stuff](https://x.com/MatijaSosic/status/1974116112548909200) eventually pays off!

***A lil' disclaimer**: If for some reason we can't get our hands on one of the prizes, or can't ship it to your location, we'll swap it out for something just as cool (promise!).*
