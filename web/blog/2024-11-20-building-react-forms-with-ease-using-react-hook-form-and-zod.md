Forms are something every developer encounters, whether as a user or on the developer side. They‚Äôre essential on most websites, but their complexity can vary wildly‚Äîfrom simple 3-field contact forms to giga-monster-t-rex, multi-page forms with 150 fields, dynamic validation, and asynchronous checks. 

In this post, we‚Äôll explore how React Hook Form, Zod, and Shadcn can be used to create an adaptable, developer-friendly solution that handles a wide range of form requirements with ease.

## The form we‚Äôll be building

Here‚Äôs the form we‚Äôll be developing in this post. I plan on writing another post about an advanced use of forms that will have even more complexity as a follow-up, so stay tuned üòÉ

## Meet the tools

Let‚Äôs look at the stack we‚Äôll use to build and manage our forms.

### **React and Wasp**

- Framework: [**Wasp**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) (full-stack framework for React, Node.js, and Prisma).
- Enables fast, efficient full-stack web development and deployment with React.

### **React Hook Form**

- Lightweight library for crafting forms in React, mainly via its `useForm` hook.
- Handles form validation, error management, and offers flexible validation method and integration with various UI component libraries.

### **Zod**

- TypeScript-first validation library for creating detailed, reusable validation schemas.
- Integrates with TypeScript types to keep validation unified and avoid duplication.

### **Shadcn/UI**

- Collection of reusable UI components which are embedded directly in project, which allows developers to take only what they need and customize those components as well.
- Offers built-in support for React Hook Form and Zod.

Here‚Äôs an example snippet showcasing a form field in Shadcn library:

```tsx
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="name"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Name</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <Input {...field} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

Even if you prefer using a different flavor of the stack, as long as you stick with React and RHF, this is still a valid example that will get you going.

## Let‚Äôs build a simple user dashboard

The application we'll use to demonstrate basic forms is an admin panel with essential CRUD operations. It will include email and password authentication and consist of two pages: a main screen displaying a table of all users, and a user creation page, which will be the star of this article.

![example data](/img/forms/data.png)

![example form](/img/forms/form.png)

Our form will include validation to ensure users cannot submit it (i.e., create a new user) without meeting the specified requirements. The User object is an excellent candidate for validation examples, as it contains a variety of data types suitable for different validations: strings, dates (e.g., date of birth), email strings, and booleans (e.g., premium user status). The complete Prisma schema file is shown below.

```sql
model Customer {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  surname String
  email String
  dateOfBirth DateTime
  premiumUser Boolean
}
```

To jumpstart our project, we‚Äôll use a predefined [Wasp template](https://wasp.sh/docs/project/starter-templates) with TypeScript, called **todo-ts**. This template comes with ready-made components and routing for authentication, including login and signup screens. It also offers a solid example of how CRUD operations work in Wasp, ideal if you‚Äôre new to the framework. Additionally, we‚Äôll leverage the new Wasp TypeScript SDK to manage our configuration, as it provides extended flexibility for customization.

## Putting it all together - Zod schema + React Hook Form instance + layout

To work with forms, we‚Äôll start by defining a Zod validation schema. Our form has three data types: strings, a date, and a boolean. We‚Äôll apply validation to most fields: `name` and `surname` are required, while `email` utilises the built-in e-mail validation. Zod simplifies validating common string types with built-in validations for different types, like emails, URLs, and UUIDs, which is helpful for our email field.

For additional validations, the date can‚Äôt be set to a future date, and the `premiumUser` field simply needs to be a boolean. Zod also provides default validation error messages, but these can be customized. For example, instead of `name: z.string().min(1)`, we could specify `name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required')`.

 

```tsx
  const formSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string().min(1, { message: 'Name is required' }),
    surname: z.string().min(1, { message: 'Surname is required' }),
    email: z.string().email({ message: 'Invalid email address' }),
    dateOfBirth: z
      .date()
      .max(new Date(), { message: 'Date cannot be in the future' }),
    premiumUser: z.boolean(),
  });
```

Our form is managed by the `useForm` hook from [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useform), which provides extensive options for handling and validating form values, checking errors, and managing form state. To integrate our Zod validation schema, we‚Äôll use a Zod resolver, allowing React Hook Form to apply the validations we defined earlier.

The form‚Äôs `defaultValues` are derived from the customer object. Since this component is used for both adding new customers and editing existing ones, we‚Äôll pass the necessary data as input. For a new customer, some sensible default values are used; for existing customers, data is retrieved from the database. Apart from setting default values and determining whether to call `createCustomer` or `updateCustomer`, all other aspects of form handling remain the same.

```tsx
type FormData = z.infer<typeof formSchema>
const form = useForm<FormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
  defaultValues: customer,
});
```

The final step is to create the form itself and assemble it in the TSX file. As shown earlier, this process is straightforward. Whether we‚Äôre using text inputs, date pickers, or checkboxes with Shadcn controls, we follow a similar structure:

- Start by creating the `FormField` element and setting its `control`, `name`, and `render` properties.
- The `render` property is key, as it contains the form element itself.
- Typically, we wrap everything in `FormItem`, add a `FormLabel` for the label, and place the controlled form element inside `FormControl` with the appropriate value and setter method.
- Finally, we include `FormMessage` below, which displays the Zod validation message if validation fails.

![form with errors](/img/forms/form-error.png)

```tsx

// Defining form schema
const formSchema = z.object({   
    dateOfBirth: z.date().max(new Date(), {
      message: 'Date of birth cannot be today, or in the future',
    }),    
});

// Defining form  
const form = useForm<FormData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: defaultValues,
});

 // Creating form control
  <FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="dateOfBirth"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem className="flex flex-col">
      <FormLabel>Date of birth</FormLabel>
      <FormControl>
        <DatePicker date={field.value} setDate={field.onChange} />
      </FormControl>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```
