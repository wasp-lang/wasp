Hola Waspeteers 🐝,

What did one plant say to the other? Aloe! Long thyme no see. 🌱

Now that we've set the tone, let me guide you through what's new in Waspworld (that would be a cool theme park, right?):

## Wasp Launch Week #3 is in the making - get ready for the Magic 🔮 🧙

As it always happens in the wilderness, after one launch week, there comes another one. And who are we to defy the laws of nature - thus, get ready for Launch Week #3!

We are aiming for the end of June, but we'll announce the exact date soon. Make sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/WaspLang) or/and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) to stay in the loop.

### After Pizzazz 🍕 ...
As you might remember, the motto/topic of our [last launch](/blog/2023/04/11/wasp-launch-week-two) was *Pizzaz*, which referred to improving the developer experience in Wasp - full-stack auth, one-line deployment, type safety, db tooling, ...

### ... Comes Magic! 🔮
While DX will always be our top priority, we're now shifting gears a bit - the keyword we chose to represent our next launch is ✨ *Magic* ✨. The reason is that now that we have a majority of the features you'd expect in a web framework in place, **we can start utilizing Wasp's unique compiler-driven approach to offer next-level features no other framework can!**

### LW3 Sneak Peek 🤫 👀
More details coming soon, but in the meanwhile, here are some of the features we're most excited about:

#### 🚧 Wasp AI 🤖 ✨
There is no mAgIc without AI! We cannot share many details on this yet, but it is something we've been exploring a lot lately. Our previous experiments have shown that, due to its declarative and human-readable nature, Wasp is naturally a very good fit for LLMs.

We'll take this to the next level for our next launch - stay tuned!

#### 🚧 Auto CRUD
Although Wasp helps a lot with bootstrapping your app, one repetitive thing that you have to do every time is implement "standard" CRUD operations for your data models.

We decided to put a stop to it - welcome our new (incoming) feature, Auto CRUD!

<ImgWithCaption
    alt="Auto CRUD"
    source="img/update-may-23/auto-crud.png"
    caption="Syntax proposal for the new Auto CRUD feature"
/>

All you have to do is specify in your .wasp file which CRUD operations you want, and they will be auto-generated for you to use in your JS/TS code. **The best part is when you update your data model, these will get updated as well! 🤯**

This feature is also a really good showcase of Wasp's compiler muscles - the best you could get with a traditional framework approach is scaffolding, which means spitting out code that will quickly get outdated and that you have to maintain.

[See a 2-min demo of Wasp Auto CRUD in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzBxpqV5USE&ab_channel=Wasp) - by our founding engineer Miho

#### 🚧 Advanced syntax completion for .wasp files (LSP)

<ImgWithCaption
    alt="Improved LSP"
    source="img/update-may-23/new-lsp.png"
/>

We're making our [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp) even better! So far it has provided highlighting and auto-completion for top-level declarations (e.g., *route, entity, query*, ...), but now it's going even deeper. Every property will display its full type as you are typing it out + you'll get a context-aware auto-completion. 


#### 🚧 Support for web sockets 🔌 🧦!
Wasp will soon support Web Sockets! This will allow you to have a persistent, real-time connection between your client and server, which is great for chat apps, games, and more.

For now it is a stand-alone feature, but it opens some really interesting possibilities - e.g. combining this with Wasp's query/action system and letting you declare a particular query to be "live". Just an idea for now but something to keep in mind as we test and receive more feedback on this feature.
