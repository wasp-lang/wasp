You know that feeling when you're waiting for a package to arrive and the tracking says "delivery delayed until January"? Yeah, we think that sucks, too (thanks so much, Temu).

We've been working on some cool stuff that we're really excited about, and we thought - why make you wait until our next launch week in January when we can give you early Xmas presents instead?

{/* truncate */}

**So here's what we're doing: On December 23rd, we're unwrapping 4 new features for the Wasp community. Consider it our gift to you for an amazing 2026! 🎄**

## Join Us for the Xmas Party! 🎉

What's a launch without a party? We're hosting a cozy [Discord call on **December 23rd at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 4 PM CET**](https://discord.gg/NQ9RNkyk?event=1450815808325423114) to unwrap all the gifts together!

We'll be:
- Doing live demos of all 4 new features
- Answering your questions
- Sharing what's coming in 2026
- Having a good time with the community

Make sure to [join our Discord and RSVP to the event](https://discord.gg/NQ9RNkyk?event=1450815808325423114) - we'd love to see you there! Bring your hot cocoa ☕

And now, let's start unpacking! As the olden song goes, *"On the Xmas Launch Day, my true full-stack batteries included web framework gave me"*:

## 🎁 Gift #1: React 19 Support

It's here! We're bringing React 19 to Wasp so you can take advantage of all the latest and greatest features from the React team.

People have been asking for this for a while now, and we're excited to finally deliver it:

/>

With React 19 support, you'll get access to some exciting improvements - new Actions and form APIs, a bunch of new hooks, ref as a prop, and [more](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19)!

## 🎁 Gift #2: Claude Code Plugin for Wasp

You're gonna love this one. We keep hearing from so many developers what a great fit Claude Code combined with Wasp is, so we decided to take things one step further - introducing official **Claude Code plugin for Wasp**!

If you haven't heard of Claude Code plugins yet - it's a way to extend Claude with custom functionality. Think of it as giving Claude superpowers for specific frameworks and workflows.

Here's what it does:

- **Knows Wasp inside-out** - Plugs in Wasp best practices and points Claude to the right documentation (even accounting for your Wasp version!)
- **Guides you through common tasks** - Adding auth, email sending, deployment, and more
- **Embedded workflows** - Common patterns and advice baked right in, so Claude can help you build the "Wasp way"

It's like having a Wasp expert sitting next to you while you code. AI-assisted development just got a whole lot better for Wasp developers! 🤖

## 🎁 Gift #3: Polar Integration in Open SaaS

[Polar](https://polar.sh) is now the hottest way to add billing to your SaaS. Think of it like Wasp, but for payment systems - it's extremely fast to add and does a ton of heavy lifting for you (subscriptions, usage-based billing, and MoR). It's also 100% open-source, so no wonder we like it!

We're integrating Polar directly into [Open SaaS](https://opensaas.sh/), making it even simpler to start accepting payments and building your SaaS business.

## 🎁 Gift #4: Wasp News

Stay in the loop without leaving your terminal! We're introducing Wasp News - a new feature that brings you important updates, tips, and announcements right in your CLI. Never miss a beat with what's happening in the Wasp ecosystem.

All you have to do is run `wasp news` in your terminal and you'll be up to date!

## See You on the 23rd! 📅

**December 23rd** is the day! We'll be sharing:
- Full feature announcements with all the details
- Video demos and tutorials
- Fun stuff on Twitter/X

Make sure you're following us so you don't miss the unwrapping:
- [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/WaspLang) - We'll be tweeting all day
