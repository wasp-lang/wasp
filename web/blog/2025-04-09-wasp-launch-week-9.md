Ciao Wasp gourmets aka Waspeteers,

we are back! It‚Äôs time for a freshly baked Launch Week (#9, if anyone is counting), and oh boy, are we cooking. We‚Äôve been hard at work for the past three months, and can‚Äôt wait to show you what‚Äôs on the latest Wasp menu.

As always, we‚Äôre throwing a nice and cozy community call where we‚Äôll show you what we baked and saut√©ed (ok, no more cooking references. And yes, I‚Äôm lying). It will take place next **Monday, April 14th, 11 AM EDT / 5 PM CET**! To reserve your spot, visit [the event in our Discord](https://discord.gg/vSJWnWvg?event=1358809963107188917) and mark yourself as interested.

So, without a further ado, let‚Äôs put the stove on (I warned you) and get cooking:

## #1: Big Thinking - what‚Äôs that all about?

With this Launch Week, we start a new chapter - **we‚Äôre now officially putting our sights at bringing Wasp to 1.0 version**. In order to do that, we needed to stop for a moment and compile everything we learned in the last four years of building, and decide what comes next.

**The vision behind Wasp remains the same - create the best, most intuitive and truly full-stack web framework out there**. We are bringing back that Laravel/Ruby on Rails feeling of super productivity [everyone is calling for](/blog/2024/05/29/why-we-dont-have-laravel-for-javascript-yet), but for the modern JavaScript, AI-infused ecosystem.

Some of the things we did along the way turned out great, and some turned out not so practical, and sometimes for the different reasons that we expected (e.g. IDE support for our own spec format). But, with all the experience and feedback you generously shared with our since Alpha (remember that?), we feel we have more clarity on the direction of Wasp than ever, and the road to 1.0 is fully open.

/>

A lot of coming features still have to be ironed out, but we feel we have all the right questions we need to ask. **And that‚Äôs exactly what we want to ultimately share with you - a full, transparent roadmap for Wasp to get to 1.0**. We want to share everything we‚Äôre thinking about, how we are seeing the ecosystem and then again get your feedback on how Wasp should fulfill all these requirements to become a truly production-ready framework.

Can‚Äôt wait!

## #2: Wasp team is growing!

We‚Äôve introduced new Waspeteers to our core team, and they can‚Äôt wait to meet you all! Being a 100% remote org, [Franjo](/blog/2025/03/20/meet-franjo-engineer-at-wasp) and [Carlos](/blog/2025/04/07/meet-carlos-engineer-at-wasp) joined us from sunny Barcelona and Croatia. They both come with unique experiences and interest which makes them a perfect to fit to work on the future of web development.

We all gathered in Croatia a few weeks ago and finally got ourselves a nice team photo:

Of course we went Ghibli with it. But my personal favorite is then going back to the original photo from it (*warning*: [don‚Äôt click it](https://x.com/MatijaSosic/status/1909321836673794116). Seriously, [don‚Äôt do it](https://x.com/MatijaSosic/status/1909321836673794116)).

Join us on the [community call on Monday](https://discord.gg/vSJWnWvg?event=1358809963107188917) and meet everybody in person! Franjo and Carlos will introduce themselves, share what convinced them to devote their lives to Wasp (too soon?), and we‚Äôll chat a bit about hiring process at Wasp in general (aka why we don‚Äôt ask algorithms and all you have to do really is send us a t-shirt).

## #3: Community day aka the cool stuff you‚Äôve been building

I repeat this every Launch Week, but this has been the busiest quarter we‚Äôve ever seen, in terms of the quality and quantity of the new Wasp apps!

Your designs are getting more stunning, time to production is shorter and shorter (thanks, Cursor and Gemini 2.5!), and your apps are more innovative than ever! From LLM-powered SaaS-es, B2B services and all the way to internal tools in your enterprises - we‚Äôve seen it all! You‚Äôve been giving us incredible feedback and we‚Äôve learned a lot from watching you build, ship and sell.

Nothing else to add except - time to build!

## #4: Open SaaS day: 10k stars, Shadcn, QoL improvements and more!

<ImgWithCaption
    alt="OpenSaaS 10k stars"
    source="img/lw9/pepe-10k-stars.png"
/>

**Open SaaS broke 10,000 stars on GitHub!** That‚Äôs a pretty huge milestone, making Open SaaS one of the most popular React/Node.js SaaS starters on GitHub. We will talk more about how we got here, what developers are asking for and what‚Äôs coming next!

We also keep improving Open SaaS every day! **There‚Äôs been a bunch of Quality of Life updates** (Zod runtime validations, S3 file upload type-safety, atomic server-side actions, ‚Ä¶)

Finally, **we‚Äôre gearing up for a big redesign of Open SaaS**! The initial design worked great to get things started, but since Open SaaS got so popular we realised it deserves a new coat of paint to help your apps stand out even more.

We are also playing around with integrating Shadcn - you can see [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas/issues/415) and share your thoughts and ideas [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas/issues/415).

## #5: See you there!

This is it - as you can tell, we have a lot of new initiatives going on and we‚Äôre extremely excited to hear what you think about it! As Wasp is maturing and its direction and shape are becoming more and more clear, it is time we started investing in longer term efforts, thus all the Big Thinking **‚Ñ¢.**

And, as usual - to stay in the loop,¬†[follow us on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/WaspLang)¬†and¬†[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX)¬†- buzz you around! üêùüêù
