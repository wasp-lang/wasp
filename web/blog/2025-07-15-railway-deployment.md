Wasp aims to be the complete package for your full-stack development needs, from full-stack type safety to async jobs, we give you all the legos. One thing that every developers needs at some point is deployment. We keep trying out different deployment providers to see which we like the best… and Railway really stood out to us.

## Why Railway?

Railway recently introduced [Railway Metal](https://blog.railway.com/p/launch-week-02-welcome) which is their cool way of saying they have their own independent infrastructure. They’ve been able to optimize their server costs and lower the prices for everybody. This makes Railway not only a powerful and stable platform but also a very reasonably priced option for many projects.

That’s why we are excited to announce that we added support for [Railway](https://railway.com/) one-command deployment to Wasp! (Fun fact: This is provider #2, Wasp CLI already had one-command deployment with [Fly.io](http://fly.io/).)

## How it works

Wasp takes the Railway experience a step further by giving a Wasp-specific deployment command. Instead of manually configuring each service of your application (the database, the server and the client), Wasp orchestrates the entire deployment with a single command:

## See it in action

Here's a a 30-second video to showcase how simple it is to deploy a Wasp app to Railway - it takes a single CLI command and ~3 minutes!

All you need to do is run "wasp deploy railway launch". Behind the scenes, the Wasp CLI:

- Deploys a PostgreSQL database
- Sets up your server
- Deploys your client application
- Wires everything together with the environment variables

After the deployment process finishes you’ll get a URL to your client app which you can share with your grandma. Time to get those cookies as a reward!
