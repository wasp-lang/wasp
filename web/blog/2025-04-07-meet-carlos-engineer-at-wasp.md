We are excited to announce that we've grown the team! üêù  This means we can ship more features and push the framework forward with more speed. 

Today, we're introducing [Carlos](https://bsky.app/profile/precioso.design), who recently joined us as a framework engineer. Through this interview, you'll get to know more about his interests and what drew him to join Wasp.

### Let‚Äôs start with two truths and a lie about yourself.

1. I was entered into a baby model agency and had a professional photo book done.
2. I‚Äôm a chair expert and can name most of the ones you might see in a museum. 
3. I won a hackathon for making innovative sex toy tech.

### Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?

I‚Äôm not a chair expert! I come from an industrial design background, and the education was very heavy on studying the history of chairs. But I forgot a lot, so I can recognize some of the most famous ones, just please don‚Äôt ask me to name them üòÖ.
    
However if anyone who reads this is missing some Spanish-language chair content in their life, I can recommend [this TikTok account](https://www.tiktok.com/@estebango__).

Unfortunately, both the other stories were one-offs. But if we ever meet in person, I‚Äôll show you the picture they took of me simulating [this classic Bill Gates photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/fnqcfy/bill_gates_chilling_with_his_pcs_in_the_1980s/) when I was nine.

### Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?

I started programming when I was around eight years old, but only as a hobby. I actually did my studies in Industrial Design, and while I lived in the Netherlands I was working as a teacher assistant on one of the more tech-focused courses. That was when I discovered that I was good at understanding what other people need from a specific tool or process, even across people from different cultural and professional background. And that I just really needed doing that from a tech position rather than a design one.

Here's a picture of me at a design futures exhibition in the Netherlands, explaining the visitors a weird scifi story to go with our project, an Arduino-based game.

At some point I dropped out and came back to Spain. I taught programming to children, and worked in a consultancy as a programmer; but my favourite job was in an HR tech enterprise where I was part of the internal frontend support team, doing [Inner Source](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-innersource/) platform work. 

When I found out about Wasp, I immediately got excited thinking that it could be a continuation of the kind of work I love doing the most. I just really like speaking with developers in the open, and creating robust tools to simplify their work!

### What is your favorite language?

I know you probably were expecting a programming language, but I‚Äôll be a cheeky and say a human one: in the past few years, I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of music in [Catalan](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vd8dkKfaMxSLA5djGZ3EP?si=2166e61920ed41ed) and [Occitan](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1MYfw8oJJ5lQisSkMKPGHl?si=2c455503a6e042d5), and I really love how they sound.
    
But on the computer side, my current favorite (and for quite some years already) is doing dark type magic in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Although I would resurrect [LiveScript](https://livescript.net/) if I could.

### What are you most excited about in Wasp?

A few years ago some friends had the idea for [vecinoscabrones.com](https://vecinoscabrones.com) and we made it together. It‚Äôs a search engine that can search for any sentence in a famous Spanish sitcom, and get you the exact moment they said it, links to that moment in streaming sites, and make a GIF out of it. And I‚Äôm very proud that I got the whole GIF subtitling and generation done on the client!

### How did you start coding?

I was obsessed with being on the family computer as a kid. First it was The Sims, but on occasions I went into `C:\` and touched things I shouldn‚Äôt, and crashed it. At some point, my parents bought me my own second-hand laptop, and by chance it had Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash installed. 

I somehow found them and started playing with first their editors and then with the code, and the rest is history. I remember one of the first things I ‚Äúcreated‚Äù was a HTML file with the lyrics to ‚ÄúAmerican Idiot‚Äù by Green Day, that I then burned to a CD to hand to my friends.

### Your dev setup?

Just a MacBook, VS Code, and Apple Reminders! I used to get really carried away trying to get everything super customized but now I‚Äôm a believer in the zen of defaults.

### What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work? Why?

The most important tools I‚Äôve found lately have been [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/), [`jj`](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/), and [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/). Specifically `jj` makes my work *so much faster.*

### Lastly, where can people find or connect with you online?

On [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/precioso.design), [Twitter](https://x.com/_cprecioso), [GitHub](https://github.com/cprecioso), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprecioso/). Also IRL in Barcelona, Spain.
