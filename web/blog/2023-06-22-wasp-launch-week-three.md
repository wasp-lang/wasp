By now, it is a tradition. For the every upcoming launch week, we ask ourselves how can we top the last one? How can we make building full-stack web apps easier, more enjoyable and get rid of even more boilerplate?

If this is the first time you're joining, check our previous launches:
- [Launch Week 1: Beta](/blog/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week)
- [Launch Week 2: Pizzazz](/blog/2023/04/11/wasp-launch-week-two)

Our first launch week was about making the promise of Wasp Alpha a reality, so you can build what you envisioned and deploy your app to production. The second launch made the whole experience much more polished, getting closer to the DX you'd expect from a mature web framework.

## Why Magic?

For this launch, with all the basics in place and [you having built thousands of apps with Wasp](/blog/2023/01/31/wasp-beta-launch-review) (thank you!), **we started pushing the boundaries of what web frameworks can do**, utilising Wasp's unique DSL/compiler approach. This is still barely scratching the surface, but you'll be able to try it out yourself and get a taste of what the future of web development will look like.

## What's coming 🐝

Every day next week, starting Monday, June 26, we'll highlight a major new feature in Wasp. We'll update this post daily as we reveal each feature, so make sure to keep coming back! Follow us on twitter ([@wasplang](https://twitter.com/WaspLang)) to stay in the loop and also [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) to join the community and get help as you're trying Wasp out.


## Launch party 🚀🎉

/>

What would a launch be without a proper event and a party? A boring, heartless event, that's what!

That's why we'll get together to celebrate the launch, our community (you!) and all the hard work that's been put into this new, fresh edition of Wasp. You will also get to meet the team and hear first-hand from the makers about the latest features and plans for the future.

The party starts at **9.30 am EDT / 3.30 pm CET** - sign up [here](https://discord.gg/p7TzVUn2?event=1121156549080002680) and make sure to mark yourself as "interested"!

As per usual, there will be memes, swag and lots of interesting dev discussions!

## Auto CRUD | Monday: The future is now 🛸

<ImgWithCaption
    alt="The future is now"
    source="img/lw3/future-is-now.gif"
/>

We'll immediately kick things off with a bang! What's the one thing that all developers universally agree is something they'd like to do less of? Writing boilerplate CRUD logic, of course! Yet, it's 2023 and the best we managed to do is get an AI write it half-correctly for us and we still have to maintain it.

That's what we are coming after - is it possible to avoid writing (or generating) CRUD code in the first place? How far can we take it and what's then even left for your to code? Join us on Monday and find out!

**When**: Monday, June 26 2023

## WebSocket Support | Tuesday: Be real, time 🔌⏱

Sometimes, you just want to keep it real. Especially when you are dealing with time. I've been dropping some hints here - have you figured out what is this about? If yes, drop us a line on twitter ([@wasplang](https://twitter.com/WaspLang)) and the first one to get it right will get a special (real and timely) award!

Another situation where you might want to keep things real is when chatting to someone, especially via the text (*wink wink hint hint 🧦*).

## Wednesday: Community Day 🤗

/>

Community is at the centre of Wasp, and Wednesday is at the centre of the week, so it's only appropriate to marry the two together. We'll spotlight the amazing OSS tools Wasp is built on top of and also you - all the cool stuff you have built with Wasp and how you're contributing every day to make our community better!

**When**: Wednesday, June 28 2023

## Wasp LSP 2.0 | Thursday: Take care of your tools 🛠

<ImgWithCaption
    alt="Tools"
    source="img/lw3/tools.gif"
/>

It's a well known fact that a developer is only as good as the tools they are using. That actually applies to anybody - if Gimli hadn't spent time sharpening his axe, he wouldn't stand a chance against these orcs, would he?

Us at Wasp, we are pretty much the same as Gimli - we take our tools seriously. As we are innovating on the framework features, our goal is to do the same with the tooling you use with Wasp. Get ready to get your hands dirty (with code).

**When**: Thursday, June 29 2023

## GPT Web App Generator | Friday: Waspularity 🤖 + Tutorial-o-thon!

<ImgWithCaption

/>

For the final day of the launch week, we have a really cool surprise for you. I'll just say it's something like Matrix but the robots are your friends and there's no that weird guy with sunglasses to ruin everything. And there might be cake.

To wrap the week up, we'll also start another hackathon, but this time in a bit different format. Since the best way to learn something is to teach it to others, we'll focus on tutorials this time! May the best tutorial win - more info coming soon.
