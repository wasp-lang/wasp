name: Setup Haskell
description: |
  This action sets up a Haskell environment for use in actions by
  adding the GHC and Cabal binaries to the PATH. It also caches
  the GHC and Cabal installations to speed up subsequent runs.

inputs:
  ghc-version:
    description: |
      The version of GHC to install.
    required: false
    default: "8.10.7"

  cabal-version:
    description: |
      The version of Cabal to install.
    required: false
    default: "latest"

  cabal-project-dir:
    description: |
      The working directory for the action.
    required: false
    default: "waspc"

  extra-cache-key-segment:
    description: |
      An extra key to use for the cache. Mainly used to keep glibc and musl
      caches separate, as they are not compatible.
    required: false
    default: "default"

        # There are two extra directories that are commonly cache, that we've
        # decided not to cache:
        #
        # - `./dist-newstyle`: Our internal code builds quite fast, and changes
        # often enough that a cache would need to be invalidated on every run, and
        # make our caching story much more complex.
        #
        # - `~/.cabal/packages`: This is a local cache of the package index. While
        # it could be useful, we build in heterogeneous environments and it is
        # not always in the same paths. From testing, in packages with a frozen
        # `index-state` like ours, the build will just download a single ~4kb file.
        # So it is not worth the complexity of caching.
        #
        # We do cache the Cabal store, which is where the actual built packages
        # are stored, as it is the most expensive part of the build, and easily
        # reusable.
