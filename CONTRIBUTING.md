# Contributing to Wasp

Wasp's compiler is built with Haskell and under the hood it generates a web application in React and NodeJS. Given that, there are several ways in which you can contribute: 
- [Wasp Compiler/CLI/LSP Internals](#wasp-compilerclilsp-internals) (Haskell)
- [Wasp as a Web Framework](#wasp-as-a-web-framework) (React, Node, HTML/CSS, database, and more)
- [Tutorials or Example Apps](#tutorials-or-example-apps)
- [Documentation](#documentation)

## Before You Begin

To get started with contributing to Wasp, follow these steps:

1. Check out the [**Getting Started**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs) guide to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of Wasp.
2. Ideally, build an app using one of the tutorials from the [**Pick a Tutorial**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app) page to gain hands-on experience.
3. Determine what aspect of Wasp you'd like to contribute to, whether it's code, documentation, tutorials, or other areas.

Let's dive into the various ways you can contribute to Wasp:

## Wasp Compiler/CLI/LSP Internals

Wasp's compiler is primarily implemented in Haskell, but you will encounter JavaScript and other web technologies because Wasp compiles its own code into these technologies. You don't need to be an expert in Haskell, as most of the code is relatively straightforward.

To get involved in this area, refer to the [**Wasp compiler README**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/README.md) for detailed instructions and guides.

If you can't find a suitable issue, don't hesitate to reach out to our Discord community for assistance or open a new issue if you have a specific contribution in mind.

## Wasp as a Web Framework

Wasp is a versatile platform for developing full-stack web applications, which involves various web development tasks.

## Tutorials or Example Apps

A great way to contribute is by creating an application using Wasp. We have an [Examples](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/examples) section on our website, as well as a [Tutorials](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app) page. You can enhance and update these resources with your own projects.

To contribute in this way, create an app and then produce a tutorial or blog post to help others replicate your work. Some notable examples include [Waspello](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/02/waspello), [Waspleau](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/01/27/waspleau), [It Wasps on My Machine](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/09/05/dev-excuses-app-tutorial), and [To-Do app](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app). Alternatively, you can rebuild your existing pet project with Wasp, which would be a valuable contribution.

## Documentation

Improving documentation is a highly valuable contribution. If you come across an issue, a broken link, or anything unclear on our [website](https://wasp-lang.dev/), please feel free to rectify it.
