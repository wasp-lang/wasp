# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
# resolver: ghcjs-0.1.0_ghc-7.10.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# resolver: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# resolver: https://example.com/snapshots/2018-01-01.yaml
resolver: lts-18.0

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
# packages:
# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
# - location:
#    git: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.git
#    commit: e7b331f14bcffb8367cd58fbfc8b40ec7642100a
# - location: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/commit/e7b331f14bcffb8367cd58fbfc8b40ec7642100a
#  subdirs:
#  - auto-update
#  - wai
packages:
- .
# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver
# using the same syntax as the packages field.
# (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
extra-deps:
  - strong-path-1.0.0.0
  - path-0.9.0
  - path-io-1.6.3

# Override default flag values for local packages and extra-deps
# flags:

# Extra package databases containing global packages
# extra-package-dbs: []

# Control whether we use the GHC we find on the path
# system-ghc: true
#
# Require a specific version of stack, using version ranges
# require-stack-version: -any # Default
# require-stack-version: ">=1.7"
#
# Override the architecture used by stack, especially useful on Windows
# arch: i386
# arch: x86_64
#
# Extra directories used by stack for building
# extra-include-dirs: [/path/to/dir]
# extra-lib-dirs: [/path/to/dir]
#
# Allow a newer minor version of GHC than the snapshot specifies
# compiler-check: newer-minor

# (Martin): I added this per instructions from haskell-language-server, in order to
#   enable type information and documentation on hover for dependencies.
#   This will cause compilation errors if a dependency contains invalid Haddock markup for older versions of GHC.
