# NOTE: Why do we specify alpine version here?
#   Because if not, we had situations where it would use the different version
#   locally and on Github CI. This way we ensure exact version is used,
#   and also have control over updating it (instead of update surprising us).

# We split Dockerfile into base, server-builder and server-production.
# This way we have separate situations -> in server-builder we build all
# we need to run the server, and then in server-production we start fresh
# and just copy what we need from server-builder, avoiding intermediate
# artifacts and any settings / pollution we don't need in production
# but only for building.
