## v0.3.1.0 (2022/02/22)

### [BREAKING CHANGE] Upgrading Prisma to version 3.9.1

We are happy to announce Wasp is now using a much newer version of Prisma! This change does not impact the Wasp DSL support for Prisma, but it does come with some caveats from Prisma based on your usage. Please see this note for any breaking changes: https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-3

*Note: When you first migrate after upgrading, you will likely see a new migration created for 3.x specific features related to updating foreign keys and indexes.*

### Various improvements

- Automatically regenerating your Prisma client, as needed, based on your Prisma schema changes.
- Tracking your NPM project dependency changes and automatically invoking `npm install`, as needed, so you are always up to date.
- and more!

## v0.3.0.0 (2022/02/04)

### [BREAKING CHANGE] New Wasp-lang syntax!

Mostly it is very similar to what it was before, with some following bigger changes:
  - `auth`, `dependencies`, and couple of other "singleton" delcarations now became part of `app` declaration.
  - All declarations now need to have name, including `route`.
  - `route` has different syntax.
  - `dependencies` have different syntax.

For exact details about new syntax, check https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/syntax .

### Various improvements

  - Better compiler error messages.
  - Nicer CLI output.
  - Added delay on recompilation to avoid redundant recompiling.
  - Added `onAuthSucceededRedirectTo` field in `app`.
  - and more!
