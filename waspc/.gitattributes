# This will always convert text files (as recognized by git) to have LF EOLs
# (i.e. it will convert any CRLF into LF) when storing them in git, and will also
# check them out with LF. This prevents any CRLFs from making it into the textual
# files in the repo and making a mess, and also ensures that dev experience is
# consistent across the platforms. This also works ok on Win because modern editors
# support LF on Win.
* text=auto eol=lf
# For .ps1 scripts on Win, it is important that their lines end with CRLF to execute correctly.
*.ps1 text eol=crlf
