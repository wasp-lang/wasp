-- | A token representing a span of text from the source.
--
-- __Note:__
--
-- The lexeme that a token represents is not stored with the token. This is
-- because the CST parser does not need to use lexemes during its parsing. The
-- effect of this is that we need to carry the source string around after parsing
-- and pass it to any functions that will need to get the lexeme from a token
-- or CST nodes. Needing to access a lexeme for a token is the edge case, since
-- for most tokens the lexeme doesn't matter. Some of the cases that need it are:
--
-- - Error reporting
-- - Getting values for literal nodes, variable names, and quoters
--
-- We could store the lexeme inside tokens and/or inside CST nodes. Two ways
-- we could go about storing lexemes in the CST nodes:
--
-- (1) We store a lexeme for every syntax node, which could lead towards
--    somewhat significant memory usage, since the lexeme for each token is
--    duplicated by all of its ancestors.
-- (2) We store a lexeme only for syntax nodes with no children, which makes it
--     kind of complicated to get the lexeme for a non-leaf node.
