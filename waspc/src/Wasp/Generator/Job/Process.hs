--   Switch from Data.Conduit.Process to Data.Conduit.Process.Typed.
--   It is a new module meant to replace Data.Conduit.Process which is about to become deprecated.

--   Returns exit code of the process once it finishes, and also sends it to the channel.
--   Makes sure to terminate the process (or process group on *nix) if exception occurs.

    -- background process gets terminated, appearing to hang.
