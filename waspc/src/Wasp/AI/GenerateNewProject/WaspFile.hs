            =============

            =============

            We are together building a new Wasp app (description at the end of prompt).
            Here is a wasp file that we generated together so far:

            ```wasp
            ${currentWaspFileContent}
            ```

            Here is the plan that we generated it based on:
            ${planJSON}

            This file likely has some mistakes: let's fix it!

            ${compileErrorsText}

            Some common mistakes to look for:
              - Don't by accident put all the declarations under `app {...}`! `route`, `page`, `job`, `action`, `query`, those are all standalone and don't go inside of `app`. Assume all the declarations are at the right level in the file and keep that as it is, don't change that.
              - Don't remove any newlines. Sometimes you return the file without newlines, don't do that.
              - Using non-default imports in page components.
                  In a Wasp `page` declaration, the `component` should always use the "default import" JS syntax.
                  Instead of `component: import { PageName } from ...`, it should 
                  always be `component: import PageName from ...`.
                  Fix these by identifying named imports in wasp `page` declarations, and replacing 
                  them with default imports. This only relates to wasp `page` declarations, other parts 
                  of a Wasp file do not have to use the default imports.

              - Missing ',' between dictionary entries, for example before `entities` field in action/query.
                Fix these by adding missing ','.
                For example, the following is missing ',' after the component field:
                ```wasp
                  page ExamplePage {
                    component: import ExamplePage from "@src/pages/ExamplePage.jsx" // <- missing ','
                    authRequired: true
                  }
                ```
              - "TODO" comments or "..." that should be replaced with actual implementation.
                Fix these by replacing them with actual implementation.
              - Strings in Wasp must use double quotes, not single quotes.
              - Value of `fn:` field in `query` or `action` not having correct import syntax,
                for example it might have invalid syntax, e.g. `fn: @src/actions.js`.
                Fix these by replacing it with correct syntax, e.g. `fn: import { actionName } from "@src/actions.js"`.
              - I noticed that you sometimes by accident add redundant "}" at the end of the Wasp file while fixing it.
                Be careful not to do that.
              - We are using SQLite as a database for Prisma, so we can't use scalar arrays in PSL, like `String[]`,
                as those are not supported in SQLite. We can of course normally use arrays of other models, like `Task[]`.
              - Wasp file should not contain any `entity` declarations! That was ok in older Wasp versions, but now entities are described in prisma.schema file, and not in wasp file.

            With this in mind, generate a new, fixed wasp file.
            Try not to do big changes like changing names, removing/adding declarations and similar, those are usually correct, focus more on obvious, smaller errors.
            Don't touch `app` declaration, `Login` page, and `Signup` page.
            Do actual fixes, don't leave comments with "TODO"!
            Make extra sure to fix compiler errors, if there are any.
            Please respond ONLY with a valid JSON of the format { fileContent: string }.
            There should be no other text in your response. Don't wrap content with the "```" code delimiters.
            Don't ommit newlines from the code.
