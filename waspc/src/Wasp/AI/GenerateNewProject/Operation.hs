        ===========

        ${operationDocPrompt}

        ===========

        We are implementing a Wasp app (check bottom for description).

        This app has the following entities:
          ${entityDecls}


        Let's now implement the following Wasp ${operationTypeText}:
         - name: ${operationName}
         - fn: ${operationFnPath}
         - description: ${operationDesc}

        Please, respond ONLY with a valid JSON, of following format:
        { "opWaspDecl": string,  // Wasp declaration.
          "opJsImpl": string,    // Javascript implementation that will go into ${operationFnPath} file.
          "opJsImports": string  // Javascript imports that will go into ${operationFnPath} file, needed by the JS implementation.
        }

        Example of response:
        { "opWaspDecl": "${operationTypeText} ${operationName} {\n  fn: import { ${operationName} } from \"${operationFnPath}\",\n  entities: [Task]\n}",
          "opJsImpl": "export const {$operationName} = async (args, context) => {\n ... \n}",
          "opJsImports": "import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'"
        }
        "opWaspDecl" and "opJsImpl" are required, "opJsImports" you can skip if none are needed.
        There should be no other text in the response, just valid JSON.

        Additional strong guidelines for you to follow:
         - There should typically be at least one entity listed under `entities` field in the wasp declaration.
         - Don't ever put "..." or "//TODO" comments in the wasp declaration (`opWaspDecl`) or js implementation (`opJsImpl`).
           Instead, always write real implementation!
         - Don't import prisma client in the JS imports, it is not needed.
         - In wasp declaration (`opWaspDecl`), make sure to use ',' before `entities:`.
           Also, make sure to use full import statement for `fn:`: `import { getTasks } from "@src/actions.js"`,
           don't provide just the file path.
         - In NodeJS implementation, you will typically want to check if user is authenticated, by doing `if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(401) }` at the start of the operation.

    Wasp Action is implemented via Wasp declaration and corresponding NodeJS implementation.
    Action can then be easily called from the client, via Wasp's RPC mechanism.

    Action example #1:
    ==================

    - Wasp declaration:
    ```wasp
    action updateTask {
      fn: import { updateTask } from "@src/taskActions.js",
      entities: [Task] // Entities that action mutates.
    }
    ```

    - NodeJS implementation (with imports):
    ```js
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const updateTask = async (args, context) => {
      if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(401) }; // If user needs to be authenticated.

      const task = await context.entities.Task.findUnique({
        where: { id: args.id }
      });
      if (task.userId !== context.user.id) { throw new HttpError(403) };

      return context.entities.Task.update({
        where: { id: args.id },
        data: { isDone: args.isDone }
      });
    }
    ```

    Action example #2:
    ==================

    ```wasp
    action deleteList {
      fn: import { deleteList } from "@src/actions.js",
      entities: [List, Card]
    }
    ```

    - NodeJS implementation (with imports):
    ```js
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const deleteList = async ({ listId }, context) => {
      if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(401) };

      // We make sure that user is not trying to delete somebody else's list.
      const list = await context.entities.List.findUnique({
        where: { id: listId }
      });
      if (list.userId !== context.user.id) { throw new HttpError(403) };

      // First delete all the cards that are in the list we want to delete.
      await context.entities.Card.deleteMany({
        where: { listId }
      });

      await context.entities.List.delete({
        where: { id: listId }
      });
    }

    Query is implemented via Wasp declaration and corresponding NodeJS implementation.
    It is important that Query doesn't do any mutations, be it on the server or external world.
    Query can then be easily called from the client, via Wasp's RPC mechanism.

    Query example #1:
    =================

    - Wasp declaration:
    ```wasp
    query fetchFilteredTasks {
      fn: import { getFilteredTasks } from "@src/taskQueries.js",
      entities: [Task] // Entities that query uses.
    }
    ```

    - NodeJS implementation (with imports):
    ```js
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const getFilteredTasks = async (args, context) => {
      if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(401) }; // If user needs to be authenticated.

      return context.entities.Task.findMany({
        where: {
          isDone: args.isDone,
          user: { id: context.user.id } // Only tasks that belong to the user.
        }
      });
    }
    ```

    Query example #2:
    =================

    - Wasp declaration:
    ```wasp
    query getAuthor {
      fn: import { getAuthor } from "@src/author/queries.js",
      entities: [Author]
    }
    ```

    - NodeJS implementation (with imports):
    ```js
    import { HttpError } from 'wasp/server'

    export const getAuthor = async ({ id }, context) => {
      // Here we don't check if user is authenticated as this query is public.

      const author = await context.entities.Author.findUnique({
        where: { id },
        select: {
          id: true,
          bio: true,
          profilePictureUrl: true
        }
      });

      if (!author) throw new HttpError(404, 'No author with id ' + id);

      return author;
