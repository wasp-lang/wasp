# Design docs

[Design doc](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/) (DD) is an informal document that primary author of a software system/feature creates before they start implementing it.
It documents the high level implementation strategy and key decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.

Contributors are encouraged to submit DDs via pull request if feature is complex and could benefit from documenting its design or from having a discussion before its implementation starts.

In this directory, we collect DDs for various Wasp features, one markdown document representing one DD.
