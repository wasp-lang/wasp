module Wasp.LSP.Debouncer
  ( -- * Smoothing Noisy Events

    -- Provides a debouncing API  events that get triggered repeatedly in a
    -- short window of time. Debouncing these events treats these repeated
    -- triggers as a single firing of the event.
    --
    -- For example, if we want to do something when the user finishes editing
    -- a file, we may look typing events. But the user will type many times
    -- to make a single logical edit, so we want to consider all of those
    -- individual typing events as one big typing event.

-- | @debounce debouncer waitMicros event fire@ prevents certain actions from
-- running too often by ignoring repeated attempts to run the action within a
-- certain period of time. This is done by \"debouncing\" actions with the same
-- @event@, which is a label for what is triggering this action to run.
--
-- When 'debounce' is called, it waits @waitMicros@ microseconds before running
-- the action @fire@. If 'debounce' is called again within @waitMicros@
-- microseconds, the previous action is cancelled and only @fire@ from the newer
-- call runs. The new call waits another @waitMicros@ and can also be cancelled.
--
-- Use this function to reduce the number of times some action is run. For example,
-- refreshing the list of exported symbols from TS files on file change is debounced,
-- since we don't want to do that after every key press in the editor.

-- ==== __Example__
-- @
-- do
--   debouncer <- newDebouncerIO
--   debounce debouncer 1000 "event a" $ putStrLn "Event A #1"
--   threadDelay 100
--   debounce debouncer 1000 "event a" $ putStrLn "Event A #2"
--   threadDelay 2000
-- @
-- Prints just @Event A #2@.
--
-- ==== __Example__
-- @
-- do
--   debouncer <- newDebouncerIO
--   debounce debouncer 1000 "event a" $ putStrLn "Event A #1"
--   threadDelay 100
--   debounce debouncer 1000 "event b" $ putStrLn "Event B #1"
--   threadDelay 2000
-- @
-- Prints both @Event A #1@ and @Event B #1@.
