-- TODO: Idea: Read .gitignore file, and ignore everything from it. This will then also cover the
--   .wasp dir, and users can easily add any custom stuff they want ignored. But, we also have to
--   be ready for the case when there is no .gitignore, that could be possible.

-- | Forever listens for any file changes at the very top level of @waspProjectDir@, and also for
-- any changes at any depth in the @waspProjectDir@/src/ dir. If there is a change, compiles Wasp
-- source files in @waspProjectDir@ and regenerates files in @outDir@. It will defer recompilation
-- until no new change was detected in the last second. It also takes 'ongoingCompilationResultMVar'
-- MVar, into which it stores the result (warnings, errors) of the latest (re)compile whenever it
-- happens. If there is already something in the MVar, it will get overwritten.
