         * - if we allow unverified login
         * - if the user is already verified
         * 
         * Let's see what happens when we **don't** allow unverified login:
         * 
         * We are handling the case of an existing auth identity in two ways:
         * 
         * 1. If the user already exists and is verified, we don't want
         *   to leak that piece of info and instead we pretend that the user
         *   was created successfully.
         *    - This prevents the attacker from learning which emails already have
         *        an account created.
         * 
         * 2. If the user is not verified:
         *   - We check when we last sent a verification email and if it was less than X seconds ago,
         *     we don't send another one.
         *   - If it was more than X seconds ago, we delete the user and create a new one.
         *   - This prevents the attacker from creating an account with somebody
         *     else's email address and therefore permanently making that email
         *     address unavailable for later account creation (by real owner).
