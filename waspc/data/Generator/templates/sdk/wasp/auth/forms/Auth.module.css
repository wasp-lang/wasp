/*
  Note about using !important with some of the components:
  This is a workaround for CSS generated by Stitches not being specific enough
  and thus being overridden by Tailwind CSS. https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/1764
  Long term we want to move away from Stitches and this is an acceptable workaround for now.
