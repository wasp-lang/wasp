     TypeScript doesn't care about the redirects we define above in "exports" field; those
     are used only in runtime. TypeScript instead follows exact path as stated in an import when
     trying to find the type declarations. Therefore, when "exports" redirect doesn't match the path
     it redirects to, we need to also let TypeScript know about it, and that can be done with
     `typesVersions` field below.
