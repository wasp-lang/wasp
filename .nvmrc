# IMPORTANT: This should be set to the lowest Node version Wasp claims to
# support. The CI reads this file when running tests.
# If you change Wasp's lowest official supported Node version here, you must
# also change it in:
#   - The compiler (Wasp.Node.Version).
#   - The docs: /web/docs/introduction/getting-started.md -> The "Requirements" section.
#   - The docs plugin: /web/src/remark/search-and-replace.ts
#   - CI files that don't read this file (search for the version string and setup-node).
